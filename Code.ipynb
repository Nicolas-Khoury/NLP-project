Summarization can be defined as a task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information and overall meaning. One benefit of this will be, you don’t need to train and build a model prior start using it for your project. It’s good to understand Cosine similarity to make the best use of the code you are going to see. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. Its measures cosine of the angle between vectors. The angle will be 0 if sentences are similar.  \""

imperfectly known.': 713, 'A couple of hundred years ago men\\npossessed the history of little more than the last three thousand years.': 1166, 'What happened before that time was a\\nmatter of legend and speculation.': 244, 'Over a large part of the civilized world it was believed and taught that the world\\nhad been created suddenly in 4004 B.C., though authorities differed as to whether this had occurred in the spring\\nor autumn of that year.': 1240, 'This fantastically precise misconception was based upon a too literal interpretation of the\\nHebrew Bible, and upon rather arbitrary theological assumptions connected therewith.': 644, 'Such ideas have long since\\nbeen abandoned by religious teachers, and it is universally recognized that the universe in which we live has to all\\nappearances existed for an enormous period of time and possibly for endless time.': 818, 'Of course there may be\\ndeception in these appearances, as a room may be made to seem endless by putting mirrors facing each other at\\neither end.': 564, 'But that the universe in which we live has existed only for six or seven thousand years may be\\nregarded as an altogether exploded idea.': 474, 'The earth, as everybody knows nowadays, is a spheroid, a sphere slightly compressed, orange fashion, with a\\ndiameter of nearly 8,000 miles.': 162, 'Its spherical shape has been known at least to a limited number of intelligent\\npeople for nearly 2,500 years, but before that time it was supposed to be flat, and various ideas which now seem\\nfantastic were entertained about its relations to the sky and the stars and planets.': 990, 'We know now that it rotates\\nupon its axis which is about 24 miles shorter than its equatorial diameter every twentyfour hours, and that this\\nis the cause of the alternations of day and night, that it circles about the sun in a slightly distorted and slowly\\nvariable oval path in a year.': 568, 'Its distance from the sun varies between ninetyone and a half millions at its nearest\\nand ninetyfour and a half million miles.': 201, 'About the earth circles a smaller sphere, the moon, at an average distance of 239,000 miles.': 126, 'Earth and moon areA Short History of the World.': 12, 'The World in Space 2not the only bodies to travel round the sun.': 85, 'There are also the planets, Mercury and Venus, at distances of\\nthirtysix and sixtyseven millions of miles and beyond the circle of the earth and disregarding a belt of\\nnumerous smaller bodies, the planetoids, there are Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune at mean distances of\\n141, 483, 886, 1,782, and 1,793 millions of miles respectively.': 365, 'These figures in millions of miles are very difficult\\nfor the mind to grasp.': 147, 'It may help the readers imagination if we reduce the sun and planets to a smaller, more\\nconceivable scale.': 209, 'If, then, we represent our earth as a little ball of one inch diameter, the sun would be a big globe nine feet across\\nand 323 yards away, that is about a fifth of a mile, four or five minutes walking.': 794, 'The moon would be a small pea\\ntwo feet and a half from the world.': 907, 'Between earth and sun there would be the two inner planets, Mercury and\\nVenus, at distances of one hundred and twentyfive and two hundred and fifty yards from the sun.': 876, 'All round and\\nabout these bodies there would be emptiness until you came to Mars, a hundred and seventyfive feet beyond the\\nearth Jupiter nearly a mile away, a foot in diameter Saturn, a little smaller, two miles off Uranus four miles off\\nand Neptune six miles off.': 951, 'Then nothingness and nothingness except for small particles and drifting scraps of\\nattenuated vapour for thousands of miles.': 146, 'The nearest star to earth on this scale would be 40,000 miles away.': 323, 'These figures will serve perhaps to give one some conception of the immense emptiness of space in which the\\ndrama of life goes on.': 555, 'For in all this enormous vacancy of space we know certainly of life only upon the surface of our earth.': 648, 'It does not\\npenetrate much more than three miles down into the 4,000 miles that separate us from the centre of our globe, and\\nit does not reach more than five miles above its surface.': 394, 'Apparently all the limitlessness of space is otherwise\\nempty and dead.': 39, 'The deepest ocean dredgings go down to five miles.': 96, 'The highest recorded flight of an aeroplane is little more than\\nfour miles.': 172, 'Men have reached to seven miles up in balloons, but at a cost of great suffering.': 530, 'No bird can fly so\\nhigh as five miles, and small birds and insects which have been carried up by aeroplanes drop off insensible far\\nbelow that level.': 345, 'The World in Time\\nIN the last fifty years there has been much very fine and interesting speculation on the part of scientific men upon\\nthe age and origin of our earth.': 1227, 'Here we cannot pretend to give even a summary of such speculations because they\\ninvolve the most subtle mathematical and physical considerations.': 132, 'The truth is that the physical and astronomical\\nsciences are still too undeveloped as yet to make anything of the sort more than an illustrative guesswork.': 361, 'The\\ngeneral tendency has been to make the estimated age of our globe longer and longer.': 296, 'It now seems probable that\\nthe earth has had an independent existence as a spinning planet flying round and round the sun for a longer period\\nthan 2,000,000,000 years.': 518, 'It may have been much longer than that.': 261, 'This is a length of time that absolutely\\noverpowers the imagination.': 227, 'Before that vast period of separate existence, the sun and earth and the other planets that circulate round the sun\\nmay have been a great swirl of diffused matter in space.': 907, 'The telescope reveals to us in various parts of the\\nheavens luminous spiral clouds of matter, the spiral nebulae, which appear to be in rotation about a centre.': 178, 'It is\\nsupposed by many astronomers that the sun and its planets were once such a spiral, and that their matter has\\nundergone concentration into its present form.': 248, 'Through majestic aeons that concentration went on until in that\\nvast remoteness of the past for which we have given figures, the world and its moon were distinguishable.': 700, 'They\\nwere spinning then much faster than they are spinning now they were at a lesser distance from the sun they\\ntravelled round it very much faster, and they were probably incandescent or molten at the surface.': 445, 'The sun itself\\nwas a much greater blaze in the heavens.A Short History of the World.': 200, 'The World in Time 3If we could go back through that infinitude of time and see the earth in this earlier stage of its history, we should\\nbehold a scene more like the interior of a blast furnace or the surface of a lava flow before it cools and cakes over\\nthan any other contemporary scene.': 968, 'No water would be visible because all the water there was would still be\\nsuperheated steam in a stormy atmosphere of sulphurous and metallic vapours.': 613, 'Beneath this would swirl and boil\\nan ocean of molten rock substance.': 214, 'Across a sky of fiery clouds the glare of the hurrying sun and moon would\\nsweep swiftly like hot breaths of flame.': 383, 'Slowly by degrees as one million of years followed another, this fiery scene would lose its eruptive\\nincandescence.': 730, 'The vapours in the sky would rain down and become less dense overhead great slaggy cakes of\\nsolidifying rock would appear upon the surface of the molten sea, and sink under it, to be replaced by other\\nfloating masses.': 1353, 'The sun and moon growing now each more distant and each smaller, would rush with\\ndiminishing swiftness across the heavens.': 319, 'The moon now, because of its smaller size, would be already cooled far\\nbelow incandescence, and would be alternately obstructing and reflecting the sunlight in a series of eclipses and\\nfull moons.': 645, 'And so with a tremendous slowness through the vastness of time, the earth would grow more and more like the\\nearth on which we live, until at last an age would come when, in the cooling air, steam would begin to condense\\ninto clouds, and the first rain would fall hissing upon the first rocks below.': 2383, 'For endless millenia the greater part of\\nthe earths water would still be vaporized in the atmosphere, but there would now be hot streams running over the\\ncrystallizing rocks below and pools and lakes into which these streams would be carrying detritus and depositing\\nsediment.': 906, 'At last a condition of things must have been attained in which a man might have stood up on earth and looked\\nabout him and lived.': 544, 'If we could have visited the earth at that time we should have stood on great lavalike\\nmasses of rock without a trace of soil or touch of living vegetation, under a stormrent sky.': 974, 'Hot and violent\\nwinds, exceeding the fiercest tornado that ever blows, and downpours of rain such as our milder, slower earth\\ntoday knows nothing of, might have assailed us.': 285, 'The water of the downpour would have rushed by us, muddy\\nwith the spoils of the rocks, coming together into torrents, cutting deep gorges and canyons as they hurried past to\\ndeposit their sediment in the earliest seas.': 470, 'Through the clouds we should have glimpsed a great sun moving\\nvisibly across the sky, and in its wake and in the wake of the moon would have come a diurnal tide of earthquake\\nand upheaval.': 801, 'And the moon, which nowadays keeps one constant face to earth, would then have been rotating\\nvisibly and showing the side it now hides so inexorably.': 551, 'The earth aged.': 55, 'One million years followed another, and the day lengthened, the sun grew more distant and\\nmilder, the moons pace in the sky slackened the intensity of rain and storm diminished and the water in the first\\nseas increased and ran together into the ocean garment our planet henceforth wore.': 873, 'But there was no life as yet upon the earth the seas were lifeless, and the rocks were barren.': 669, 'The Beginnings of Life\\nAS everybody knows nowadays, the knowledge we possess of life before the beginnings of human memory and\\ntradition is derived from the markings and fossils of living things in the stratified rocks.': 661, 'We find preserved in\\nshale and slate, limestone, and sandstone, bones, shells, fibres, stems, fruits, footmarks, scratchings and the like,\\nside by side with the ripple marks of the earliest tides and the pittings of the earliest rainfalls.': 356, 'It is by the\\nsedulous examination of this Record of the Rocks that the past history of the earths life has been pieced together.': 612, 'That much nearly everybody knows today.': 227, 'The sedimentary rocks do not lie neatly stratum above stratum they\\nhave been crumpled, bent, thrust about, distorted and mixed together like the leaves of a library that has been\\nrepeatedly looted and burnt, and it is only as a result of many devoted lifetimes of work that the record has been\\nput into order and read.': 589, 'The whole compass of time represented by the record of the rocks is now estimated asA Short History of the World.': 346, 'The Beginnings of Life 41,600,000,000 years.': 162, 'The earliest rocks in the record are called by geologists the Azoic rocks, because they show no traces of life.': 443, 'Great areas of these Azoic rocks lie uncovered in North America, and they are of such a thickness that geologists\\nconsider that they represent a period of at least half of the 1,600,000,000 which they assign to the whole\\ngeological record.': 296, 'Let me repeat this profoundly significant fact.': 43, 'Half the great interval of time since land and sea\\nwere first distinguishable on earth has left us no traces of life.': 1472, 'There are ripplings and rain marks still to be found\\nin these rocks, but no marks nor vestiges of any living thing.': 414, 'Then, as we come up the record, signs of past life appear and increase.': 394, 'The age of the worlds history in which we\\nfind these past traces is called by geologists the Lower Palaeozoic age.': 713, 'The first indications that life was astir are\\nvestiges of comparatively simple and lowly things the shells of small shellfish, the stems and flowerlike heads of\\nzoophytes, seaweeds and the tracks and remains of sea worms and crustacea.': 798, 'Very early appear certain creatures\\nrather like plantlice, crawling creatures which could roll themselves up into balls as the plantlice do, the\\ntrilobites.': 456, 'Later by a few million years or so come certain sea scorpions, more mobile and powerful creatures than\\nthe world had ever seen before.': 933, 'None of these creatures were of very great size.': 498, 'Among the largest were certain of the sea scorpions, which\\nmeasured nine feet in length.': 159, 'There are no signs whatever of land life of any sort, plant or animal there are no\\nfishes nor any vertebrated creatures in this part of the record.': 568, 'Essentially all the plants and creatures which have\\nleft us their traces from this period of the earths history are shallowwater and intertidal beings.': 530, 'If we wished to\\nparallel the flora and fauna of the Lower Palaeozoic rocks on the earth today, we should do it best, except in the\\nmatter of size, by taking a drop of water from a rock pool or scummy ditch and examining it under a microscope.': 317, 'The little crustacea, the small shellfish, the zoophytes and algae we should find there would display a quite\\nstriking resemblance to these clumsier, larger prototypes that once were the crown of life upon our planet.': 1020, 'It is well, however, to bear in mind that the Lower Palaeozoic rocks probably do not give us anything at all\\nrepresentative of the first beginnings of life on our planet.': 798, 'Unless a creature has bones or other hard parts, unless\\nit wears a shell or is big enough and heavy enough to make characteristic footprints and trails in mud, it is\\nunlikely to leave any fossilized traces of its existence behind.': 262, 'Today there are hundreds of thousands of species\\nof small softbodied creatures in our world which it is inconceivable can ever leave any mark for future geologists\\nto discover.': 686, 'In the worlds past, millions of millions of species of such creatures may have lived and multiplied\\nand flourished and passed away without a trace remaining.': 409, 'The waters of the warm and shallow lakes and seas of\\nthe socalled Azoic period may have teemed with an infinite variety of lowly, jellylike, shellless and boneless\\ncreatures, and a multitude of green scummy plants may have spread over the sunlit intertidal rocks and beaches.': 529, 'The Record of the Rocks is no more a complete record of life in the past than the books of a bank are a record of\\nthe existence of everybody in the neighbourhood.': 424, 'It is only when a species begins to secrete a shell or a spicule or\\na carapace or a limesupported stem, and so put by something for the future, that it goes upon the Record.': 395, 'But in\\nrocks of an age prior to those which bear any fossil traces, graphite, a form of uncombined carbon, is sometimes\\nfound, and some authorities consider that it may have been separated out from combination through the vital\\nactivities of unknown living things.': 584, 'The Age of Fishes\\nIN the days when the world was supposed to have endured for only a few thousand years, it was supposed that the\\ndifferent species of plants and animals were fixed and final they had all been created exactly as they are today,\\neach species by itself.': 1020, 'But as men began to discover and study the Record of the Rocks this belief gave place to\\nthe suspicion that many species had changed and developed slowly through the course of ages, and this again\\nexpanded into a belief in what is called Organic Evolution, a belief that all species of life upon earth, animal and\\nvegetable alike, are descended by slow continuous processes of change from some very simple ancestral form ofA Short History of the World.': 1404, 'The Age of Fishes 5life, some almost structureless living substance, far back in the socalled Azoic seas.': 280, 'This question of Organic Evolution, like the question of the age of the earth, has in the past been the subject of\\nmuch bitter controversy.': 529, 'There was a time when a belief in organic evolution was for rather obscure reasons\\nsupposed to be incompatible with sound Christian, Jewish and Moslem doctrine.': 321, 'That time has passed, and the\\nmen of the most orthodox Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Mohammedan belief are now free to accept this newer\\nand broader view of a common origin of all living things.': 714, 'No life seems to have happened suddenly upon earth.': 615, 'Life grew and grows.': 48, 'Age by age through gulfs of time at which imagination reels, life has been growing from a\\nmere stirring in the intertidal slime towards freedom, power and consciousness.': 829, 'Life consists of individuals.': 9, 'These individuals are definite things, they are not like the lumps and masses, nor even\\nthe limitless and motionless crystals, of nonliving matter, and they have two characteristics no dead matter\\npossesses.': 521, 'They can assimilate other matter into themselves and make it part of themselves, and they can\\nreproduce themselves.': 157, 'They eat and they breed.': 9, 'They can give rise to other individuals, for the most part like\\nthemselves, but always also a little different from themselves.': 499, 'There is a specific and family resemblance between\\nan individual and its offspring, and there is an individual difference between every parent and every offspring it\\nproduces, and this is true in every species and at every stage of life.': 638, 'Now scientific men are not able to explain to us either why offspring should resemble nor why they should differ\\nfrom their parents.': 350, 'But seeing that offspring do at once resemble and differ, it is a matter rather of common sense\\nthan of scientific knowledge that, if the conditions under which a species live are changed, the species should\\nundergo some correlated changes.': 432, 'Because in any generation of the species there must be a number of individuals\\nwhose individual differences make them better adapted to the new conditions under which the species has to live,\\nand a number whose individual differences make it rather harder for them to live.': 841, 'And on the whole the former\\nsort will live longer, bear more offspring, and reproduce themselves more abundantly than the latter, and so\\ngeneration by generation the average of the species will change in the favourable direction.': 299, 'This process, which is\\ncalled Natural Selection, is not so much a scientific theory as a necessary deduction from the facts of reproduction\\nand individual difference.': 309, 'There may be many forces at work varying, destroying and preserving species, about\\nwhich science may still be unaware or undecided, but the man who can deny the operation of this process of\\nnatural selection upon life since its beginning must be either ignorant of the elementary facts of life or incapable\\nof ordinary thought.': 1824, 'Many scientific men have speculated about the first beginning of life and their speculations are often of great\\ninterest, but there is absolutely no definite knowledge and no convincing guess yet of the way in which life began.': 1731, 'But nearly all authorities are agreed that it probably began upon mud or sand in warm sunlit shallow brackish\\nwater, and that it spread up the beaches to the intertidal lines and out to the open waters.': 626, 'That early world was a world of strong tides and currents.': 1045, 'An incessant destruction of individuals must have been\\ngoing on through their being swept up the beaches and dried, or by their being swept out to sea and sinking down\\nout of reach of air and sun.': 282, 'Early conditions favoured the development of every tendency to root and hold on,\\nevery tendency to form an outer skin and casing to protect the stranded individual from immediate desiccation.': 359, 'From the very earliest any tendency to sensitiveness to taste would turn the individual in the direction of food, and\\nany sensitiveness to light would assist it to struggle back out of the darkness of the sea deeps and caverns or to\\nwriggle back out of the excessive glare of the dangerous shallows.': 741, 'Probably the first shells and body armour of living things were protections against drying rather than against\\nactive enemies.': 476, 'But tooth and claw come early into our earthly history.': 418, 'We have already noted the size of the earlier water scorpions.': 167, 'For long ages such creatures were the supreme\\nlords of life.': 381, 'Then in a division of these Palaeozoic rocks called the Silurian division, which many geologists now\\nsuppose to be as old as five

the Devonian system.': 221, 'They are so\\nprevalent that this period of the Record of the Rocks has been called the Age of Fishes.': 121, 'Fishes of a pattern now\\ngone from the earth, and fishes allied to the sharks and sturgeons of today, rushed through the waters, leapt in\\nthe air, browsed among the seaweeds, pursued and preyed upon one another, and gave a new liveliness to the\\nwaters of the world.': 1649, 'None of these were excessively big by our present standards.': 64, 'Few of them were more than\\ntwo or three feet long, but there were exceptional forms which were as long as twenty feet.': 397, 'We know nothing from geology of the ancestors of these fishes.': 83, 'They do not appear to be related to any of the\\nforms that preceded them.': 55, 'Zoologists have the most interesting views of their ancestry, but these they derive from\\nthe study of the development of the eggs of their still living relations, and from other sources.': 344, 'Apparently the\\nancestors of the vertebrata were softbodied and perhaps quite small swimming creatures who began first to\\ndevelop hard parts as teeth round and about their mouths.': 619, 'The teeth of a skate or dogfish cover the roof and floor\\nof its mouth and pass at the lip into the flattened toothlike scales that encase most of its body.': 67, 'As the fishes\\ndevelop these teeth scales in the geological record, they swim out of the hidden darkness of the past into the light,\\nthe first vertebrated animals visible in the record.': 506, 'V. The Age of the Coal Swamps\\nTHE LAND during this Age of Fishes was apparently quite lifeless.': 62, 'Crags and uplands of barren rock lay under\\nthe sun and rain.': 75, 'There was no real soilfor as yet there were no earthworms which help to make a soil, and no\\nplants to break up the rock particles into mould there was no trace of moss or lichen.': 210, 'Life was still only in the\\nsea.': 241, 'Over this world of barren rock played great changes of climate.': 992, 'The causes of these changes of climate were very\\ncomplex and they have still to be properly estimated.': 216, 'The changing shape of the earths orbit, the gradual shifting\\nof the poles of rotation, changes in the shapes of the continents, probably even fluctuations in the warmth of the\\nsun, now conspired to plunge great areas of the earths surface into long periods of cold and ice and now again for\\nmillions of years spread a warm or equable climate over this planet.': 1104, 'There seem to have been phases of great\\ninternal activity in the worlds history, when in the course of a few million years accumulated upthrusts would\\nbreak out in lines of volcanic eruption and upheaval and rearrange the mountain and continental outlines of the\\nglobe, increasing the depth of the sea and the height of the mountains and exaggerating the extremes of climate.': 1407, 'And these would be followed by vast ages of comparative quiescence, when frost, rain and river would wear\\ndown the mountain heights and carry great masses of silt to fill and raise the sea bottoms and spread the seas, ever\\nshallower and wider, over more and more of the land.': 1280, 'There have been high and deep ages in the worlds history\\nand low and level ages.': 414, 'The reader must dismiss from his mind any idea that the surface of the earth has been\\ngrowing steadily cooler since its crust grew solid.': 365, 'After that much cooling had been achieved, the internal\\ntemperature ceased to affect surface conditions.': 230, 'There are traces of periods of superabundant ice and snow, of\\nGlacial Ages, that is, even in the Azoic period.': 202, 'It was only towards the close of the Age of Fishes, in a period of extensive shallow seas and lagoons, that life\\nspread itself out in any effectual way from the waters on to the land.': 624, 'No doubt the earlier types of the forms that\\nnow begin to appear in great abundance had already been developing in a rare and obscure manner for many\\nscores of millions of years.': 953, 'But now came their opportunity.': 165, 'Plants no doubt preceded animal forms in this invasion of the land, but the animals probably followed up the plant\\nemigration very closely.': 319, 'The first problem that the plant had to solve was the problem of some sustaining stiff\\nsupport to hold up its fronds to the sunlight when the buoyant water was withdrawn the second was the problemA Short History of the World.': 404, 'V.

development of woody tissue which both sustained the plant and\\nacted as water carrier to the leaves.': 255, 'The Record of the Rocks is suddenly crowded by a vast variety of woody\\nswamp plants, many of them of great size, big tree mosses, tree ferns, gigantic horsetails and the like.': 842, 'And with\\nthese, age by age, there crawled out of the water a great variety of animal forms.': 794, 'There were centipedes and\\nmillipedes there were the first primitive insects there were creatures related to the ancient king crabs and sea\\nscorpions which became the earliest spiders and land scorpions, and presently there were vertebrated animals.': 898, 'Some of the earlier insects were very large.': 60, 'There were dragon flies in this period with wings that spread out to\\ntwentynine inches.': 130, 'In various ways these new orders and genera had adapted themselves to breathing air.': 361, 'Hitherto all animals had\\nbreathed air dissolved in water, and that indeed is what all animals still have to do.': 319, 'But now in divers fashions the\\nanimal kingdom was acquiring the power of supplying its own moisture where it was needed.': 228, 'A man with a\\nperfectly dry lung would suffocate today his lung surfaces must be moist in order that air may pass through\\nthem into his blood.': 660, 'The adaptation to air breathing consists in all cases either in the development of a cover to\\nthe oldfashioned gills to stop evaporation, or in the development of tubes or other new breathing organs lying\\ndeep inside the body and moistened by a watery secretion.': 523, 'The old gills with which the ancestral fish of the\\nvertebrated line had breathed were inadaptable to breathing upon land, and in the case of this division of the\\nanimal kingdom it is the swimming bladder of the fish which becomes a new, deepseated breathing organ, the\\nlung.': 912, 'The kind of animals known as amphibia, the frogs and newts of today, begin their lives in the water and\\nbreathe by gills and subsequently the lung, developing in the same way as the swimming bladder of many fishes\\ndo, as a baglike outgrowth from the throat, takes over the business of breathing, the animal comes out on land,\\nand the gills dwindle and the gill slits disappear.': 564, 'All except an outgrowth of one gill slit, which becomes the\\npassage of the ear and eardrum.': 280, 'The animal can now live only in the air, but it must return at least to the edge of\\nthe water to lay its eggs and reproduce its kind.': 237, 'All the airbreathing vertebrata of this age of swamps and plants belonged to the class amphibia.': 179, 'They were\\nnearly all of them forms related to the newts of today, and some of them attained a considerable size.': 171, 'They were\\nland animals, it is true, but they were land animals needing to live in and near moist and swampy places, and all\\nthe great trees of this period were equally amphibious in their habits.': 852, 'None of them had yet developed fruits and\\nseeds of a kind that could fall on land and develop with the help only of such moisture as dew and rain could\\nbring.': 434, 'They all had to shed their spores in water, it would seem, if they were to germinate.': 262, 'It is one of the most beautiful interests of that beautiful science, comparative anatomy, to trace the complex and\\nwonderful adaptations of living things to the necessities of existence in air.': 537, 'All living things, plants and animals\\nalike, are primarily water things.': 284, 'For example all the higher vertebrated animals above the fishes, up to and\\nincluding man, pass through a stage in their development in the egg or before birth in which they have gill slits\\nwhich are obliterated before the young emerge.': 407, 'The bare, waterwashed eye of the fish is protected in the higher\\nforms from drying up by eyelids and glands which secrete moisture.': 70, 'The weaker sound vibrations of air\\nnecessitate an eardrum.': 35, 'In nearly every organ of the body similar modifications and adaptations are to be\\ndetected, similar patchingsup to meet aerial conditions.': 239, 'This Carboniferous age, this age of the amphibia, was an age of life in the swamps and lagoons and on the low\\nbanks among these waters.': 716, 'Thus far life had now extended.': 353, 'The hills and high lands were still quite barren and\\nlifeless.': 273, 'Life had learnt to breathe air indeed, but it still had its roots in its native water it still had to return to the\\nwater to reproduce its kind.A Short History of the World.': 503, 'The Age of Reptiles\\nTHE ABUNDANT life of the Carboniferous period was succeeded by a vast cycle of dry and bitter ages.': 393, 'They\\nare represented in the Record of the Rocks by thick deposits of sandstones and the like, in which fossils are\\ncomparatively few.': 161, 'The temperature of the world fluctuated widely, and there were long periods of glacial cold.': 606, 'Over great areas the former profusion of swamp vegetation ceased, and, overlaid by these newer deposits, it began\\nthat process of compression and mineralization that gave the world most of the coal deposits of today.': 1196, 'But it is during periods of change that life undergoes its most rapid modifications, and under hardship that it\\nlearns its hardest lessons.': 288, 'As conditions revert towards warmth and moisture again we find a new series of animal\\nand plant forms established.': 524, 'We find in the record the remains of vertebrated animals that laid eggs which, instead\\nof hatching out tadpoles which needed to live for a time in water, carried on their development before hatching to\\na stage so nearly like the adult form that the young could live in air from the first moment of independent\\nexistence.': 1251, 'Gills had been cut out altogether, and the gill slits only appeared as an embryonic phase.': 125, 'These new creatures without a tadpole stage were the Reptiles.': 373, 'Concurrently there had been a development of\\nseedbearing trees, which could spread their seed, independently of swamp or lakes.': 241, 'There were now palmlike\\ncycads and many tropical conifers, though as yet there were no flowering plants and no grasses.': 212, 'There was a great\\nnumber of ferns.': 492, 'And there was now also an increased variety of insects.': 153, 'There were beetles, though bees and\\nbutterflies had yet to come.': 141, 'But all the fundamental forms of a new real land fauna and flora had been laid down\\nduring these vast ages of severity.': 492, 'This new land life needed only the opportunity of favourable conditions to\\nflourish and prevail.': 650, 'Age by age and with abundant fluctuations that mitigation came.': 298, 'The still incalculable movements of the earths\\ncrust, the changes in its orbit, the increase and diminution of the mutual inclination of orbit and pole, worked\\ntogether to produce a great spell of widely diffused warm conditions.': 817, 'The period lasted altogether, it is now\\nsupposed, upwards of two hundred million years.': 475, 'It is called the Mesozoic period, to distinguish it from the\\naltogether vaster Palaeozoic and Azoic periods together fourteen hundred millions that preceded it, and from the\\nCainozoic or new life period that intervened between its close and the present time, and it is also called the Age of\\nReptiles because of the astonishing predominance and variety of this form of life.': 1569, 'It came to an end some eighty\\nmillion years ago.': 430, 'In the world today the genera of Reptiles are comparatively few and their distribution is very limited.': 560, 'They are\\nmore various, it is true, than are the few surviving members of the order of the amphibia which once in the\\nCarboniferous period ruled the world.': 695, 'We still have the snakes, the turtles and tortoises the Chelonia, the\\nalligators and crocodiles, and the lizards.': 172, 'Without exception they are creatures requiring warmth all the year\\nround they cannot stand exposure to cold, and it is probable that all the reptilian beings of the Mesozoic suffered\\nunder the same limitation.': 161, 'It was a hothouse fauna, living amidst a hothouse flora.': 82, 'It endured no frosts.': 8, 'But the\\nworld had at least attained a real dry land fauna and flora as distinguished from the mud and swamp fauna and\\nflora of the previous heyday of life upon earth.': 1216, 'All the sorts of reptile we know now were much more abundantly represented then, great turtles and tortoises, big\\ncrocodiles and many lizards and snakes, but in addition there was a number of series of wonderful creatures that\\nhave now vanished altogether from the earth.': 999, 'There was a vast variety of beings called the Dinosaurs.': 132, 'Vegetation\\nwas now spreading over the lower levels of the world, reeds, brakes of fern and the like and browsing upon this\\nabundance came a multitude of herbivorous reptiles, which increased in size as the Mesozoic period rose to its\\nclimax.': 1282, 'Some of these beasts exceeded in size any other land animals that have ever lived they were as large as\\nwhales.': 244, 'The Diplodocus Carnegii for example measured eightyfour feet from snout to tail the Gigantosaurus\\nwas even greater it measured a hundred feet.': 217, 'Living upon these monsters was a swarm of carnivorous Dinosaurs\\nof a corresponding size.': 321, 'One of these, the Tyrannosaurus, is figured and described in many books as the last wordA Short History of the World.': 235, 'The Age of Reptiles 9in reptilian frightfulness.': 7, 'While these great creatures pastured and pursued amidst the fronds and evergreens of the Mesozoic jungles,\\nanother now vanished tribe of reptiles, with a batlike development of the fore limbs, pursued insects and one\\nanother, first leapt and parachuted and presently flew amidst the fronds and branches of the forest trees.': 1346, 'These were the first flying creatures with backbones they mark a new achievement in the\\ngrowing powers of vertebrated life.': 891, 'Moreover some of the reptiles were returning to the sea waters.': 116, 'Three groups of big swimming beings had\\ninvaded the sea from which their ancestors had come the Mososaurs, the Plesiosaurs, and Ichthyosaurs.': 215, 'Some of\\nthese again approached the proportions of our present whales.': 40, 'The Ichthyosaurs seem to have been quite seagoing\\ncreatures, but the Plesiosaurs were a type of animal that has no cognate form today.': 245, 'The body was stout and big\\nwith paddles, adapted either for swimming or crawling through marshes, or along the bottom of shallow waters.': 143, 'The comparatively small head was poised on a vast snake of neck, altogether outdoing the neck of the swan.': 206, 'Either the Plesiosaur swam and searched for food under the water and fed as the swan will do, or it lurked under\\nwater and snatched at passing fish or beast.': 119, 'Such was the predominant land life throughout the Mesozoic age.': 481, 'It was by our human standards an advance upon\\nanything that had preceded it.': 473, 'It had produced land animals greater in size, range, power and activity, more vital\\nas people say, than anything the world had seen before.': 1103, 'In the seas there had been no such advance but a great\\nproliferation of new forms of life.': 1000, 'An enormous variety of squidlike creatures with chambered shells, for the\\nmost part coiled, had appeared in the shallow seas, the Ammonites.': 202, 'They had had predecessors in the Palaeozoic\\nseas, but now was their age of glory.': 160, 'Today they have left no survivors at all their nearest relation is the pearly\\nNautilus, an inhabitant of tropical waters.': 75, 'And a new and more prolific type of fish with lighter, finer scales than\\nthe platelike and toothlike coverings that had hitherto prevailed, became and has since remained predominant\\nin the seas and rivers.': 564, 'The First Birds and the First Mammals\\nIN a few paragraphs a picture of the lush vegetation and swarming reptiles of that first great summer of life, the\\nMesozoic period, has been sketched.': 1052, 'But while the Dinosaurs lorded it over the hot selvas and marshy plains and\\nthe Pterodactyls filled the forests with their flutterings and possibly with shrieks and croakings as they pursued the\\nhumming insect life of the still flowerless shrubs and trees, some less conspicuous and less abundant forms upon\\nthe margins of this abounding life were acquiring certain powers and learning certain lessons of endurance, that\\nwere to be of the utmost value to their race when at last the smiling generosity of sun and earth began to fade.': 1568, 'A group of tribes and genera of hopping reptiles, small creatures of the dinosaur type, seem to have been pushed\\nby competition and the pursuit of their enemies towards the alternatives of extinction or adaptation to colder\\nconditions in the higher hills or by the sea.': 485, 'Among these distressed tribes there was developed a new type of\\nscalescales that were elongated into quilllike forms and that presently branched into the crude beginnings of\\nfeathers.': 472, 'These quilllike scales lay over one another and formed a heatretaining covering more efficient than\\nany reptilian covering that had hitherto existed.': 396, 'So they permitted an invasion of colder regions that were\\notherwise uninhabited.': 54, 'Perhaps simultaneously with these changes there arose in these creatures a greater\\nsolicitude for their eggs.': 118, 'Most reptiles are apparently quite careless about their eggs, which are left for sun and\\nseason to hatch.': 166, 'But some of the varieties upon this new branch of the tree of life were acquiring a habit of\\nguarding their eggs and keeping them warm with the warmth of their bodies.': 846, 'With these adaptations to cold other internal modifications were going on that made these creatures, the primitive\\nbirds, warmblooded and independent of basking.': 377, 'The very earliest birds seem to have been seabirds living upon\\nfish, and their fore limbs were not wings but paddles rather after the penguin type.': 512, 'That peculiarly primitive bird,A Short History of the World.': 67, 'The First Birds and the First Mammals 10the New Zealand Kiwi, has feathers of a very simple sort, and neither flies nor appears to be descended from\\nflying ancestors.': 140, 'In the development of the birds, feathers came before wings.': 249, 'But once the feather was developed\\nthe possibility of making a light spread of feathers led inevitably to the wing.': 172, 'We know of the fossil remains of\\none bird at least which had reptilian teeth in its jaw and a long reptilian tail, but which also had a true birds wing\\nand which certainly flew and held its own among the pterodactyls of the Mesozoic time.': 925, 'Nevertheless birds were\\nneither varied nor abundant in Mesozoic times.': 81, 'If a man could go back to typical Mesozoic country, he might\\nwalk for days and never see or hear such a thing as a bird, though he would see a great abundance of pterodactyls\\nand insects among the fronds and reeds.': 1432, 'And another thing he would probably never see, and that would be any sign of a mammal.': 618, 'Probably the first\\nmammals were in existence millions of years before the first thing one could call a bird, but they were altogether\\ntoo small and obscure and remote for attention.': 1313, 'The earliest mammals, like the earliest birds, were creatures driven by competition and pursuit into a life of\\nhardship and adaptation to cold.': 513, 'With them also the scale became quilllike, and was developed into a\\nheatretaining covering and they too underwent modifications, similar in kind though different in detail, to\\nbecome warmblooded and independent of basking.': 494, 'Instead of feathers they developed hairs, and instead of\\nguarding and incubating their eggs they kept them warm and safe by retaining them inside their bodies until they\\nwere almost mature.': 165, 'Most of them became altogether vivaparous and brought their young into the world alive.': 714, 'And even after their young were born they tended to maintain a protective and nutritive association with them.': 150, 'Most but not all mammals today have mammae and suckle their young.': 104, 'Two mammals still live which lay eggs\\nand which have not proper mammae, though they nourish their young by a nutritive secretion of the under skin\\nthese are the duckbilled platypus and the echidna.': 325, 'The echidna lays leathery eggs and then puts them into a\\npouch under its belly, and so carries them about warm and safe until they hatch.': 42, 'But just as a visitor to the Mesozoic world might have searched for days and weeks before finding a bird, so,\\nunless he knew exactly where to go and look, he might have searched in vain for any traces of a mammal.': 728, 'Both\\nbirds and mammals would have seemed very eccentric and secondary and unimportant creatures in Mesozoic\\ntimes.': 304, 'The Age of Reptiles lasted, it is now guessed, eighty million years.': 192, 'Had any quasihuman intelligence been\\nwatching the world through that inconceivable length of time, how safe and eternal the sunshine and abundance\\nmust have seemed, how assured the wallowing prosperity of the dinosaurs and the flapping abundance of the\\nflying lizards And then the mysterious rhythms and accumulating forces of the universe began to turn against that\\nquasieternal stability.': 1009, 'That run of luck for life was running out.': 241, 'Age by age, myriad of years after myriad of\\nyears, with halts no doubt and retrogressions, came a change towards hardship and extreme conditions, came great\\nalterations of level and great redistributions of mountain and sea.': 1934, 'We find one thing in the Record of the Rocks\\nduring the decadence of the long Mesozoic age of prosperity that is very significant of steadily sustained changes\\nof condition, and that is a violent fluctuation of living forms and the appearance of new and strange species.': 1027, 'Under the gathering threat of extinction the older orders and genera are displaying their utmost capacity for\\nvariation and adaptation.': 79, 'The Ammonites for example in these last pages of the Mesozoic chapter exhibit a\\nmultitude of fantastic forms.': 182, 'Under settled conditions there is no encouragement for novelties they do not\\ndevelop, they are suppressed what is best adapted is already there.': 186, 'Under novel conditions it is the ordinary type\\nthat suffers, and the novelty that may have a better chance to survive and establish itself.': 231, 'There comes a break in the Record of the Rocks that may represent several million years.': 329, 'There is a veil here still,\\nover even the outline of the history of life.': 764, 'When it lifts again, the Age of Reptiles is at an end the Dinosaurs, the\\nPlesiosaurs and Ichthyosaurs, the Pterodactyls, the innumerable genera and species of Ammonite have all gone\\nabsolutely.': 122, 'In all their stupendous variety they have died out and left no descendants.': 99, 'The cold has killed them.': 29, 'All their final variations were insufficient they had never hit upon survival conditions.': 415, 'The world had passed\\nthrough a phase of extreme conditions beyond their powers of endurance, a slow and complete massacre ofA Short History of the World.': 696, 'The First Birds and the First Mammals 11Mesozoic life has occurred, and we find now a new scene, a new and hardier flora, and a new and hardier fauna in\\npossession of the world.': 1599, 'It is still a bleak and impoverished scene with which this new volume of the book of life begins.': 698, 'The cycads and\\ntropical conifers have given place very largely to trees that shed their leaves to avoid destruction by the snows of\\nwinter and to flowering plants and shrubs, and where there was formerly a profusion of reptiles, an increasing\\nvariety of birds and mammals is entering into their inheritance.': 240, 'The Age of Mammals\\nTHE OPENING of the next great period in the life of the earth, the Cainozoic period, was a period of upheaval\\nand extreme volcanic activity.': 979, 'Now it was that the vast masses of the Alps and Himalayas and the mountain\\nbackbone of the Rockies and Andes were thrust up, and that the rude outlines of our present oceans and continents\\nappeared.': 160, 'The map of the world begins to display a first dim resemblance to the map of today.': 842, 'It is estimated\\nnow that between forty and eighty million years have elapsed from the beginnings of the Cainozoic period to the\\npresent time.': 521, 'At the outset of the Cainozoic period the climate of the world was austere.': 567, 'It grew generally warmer until a fresh\\nphase of great abundance was reached, after which conditions grew hard again and the earth passed into a series\\nof extremely cold cycles, the Glacial Ages, from which apparently it is now slowly emerging.': 865, 'But we do not know sufficient of the causes of climatic change at present to forecast the possible fluctuations of\\nclimatic conditions that lie before us.': 239, 'We may be moving towards increasing sunshine or lapsing towards another\\nglacial age volcanic activity and the upheaval of mountain masses may be increasing or diminishing we do not\\nknow we lack sufficient science.': 683, 'With the opening of this period the grasses appear for the first time there is pasture in the world and with the full\\ndevelopment of the once obscure mammalian type, appear a number of interesting grazing animals and of\\ncarnivorous types which prey upon these.': 1598, 'At first these early mammals seem to differ only in a few characters from the great herbivorous and carnivorous\\nreptiles that ages before had flourished and then vanished from the earth.': 979, 'A careless observer might suppose that\\nin this second long age of warmth and plenty that was now beginning, nature was merely repeating the first, with\\nherbivorous and carnivorous mammals to parallel the herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs, with birds replacing\\npterodactyls and so on.': 735, 'But this would be an altogether superficial comparison.': 229, 'The variety of the universe is\\ninfinite and incessant it progresses eternally history never repeats itself and no parallels are precisely true.': 443, 'The\\ndifferences between the life of the Cainozoic and Mesozoic periods are far profounder than the resemblances.': 363, 'The most fundamental of all these differences lies in the mental life of the two periods.': 401, 'It arises essentially out of\\nthe continuing contact of parent and offspring which distinguishes mammalian and in a lesser degree bird life,\\nfrom the life of the reptile.': 511, 'With very few exceptions the reptile abandons its egg to hatch alone.': 19, 'The young\\nreptile has no knowledge whatever of its parent its mental life, such as it is, begins and ends with its own\\nexperiences.': 369, 'It may tolerate the existence of its fellows but it has no communication with them it never imitates,\\nnever learns from them, is incapable of concerted action with them.': 302, 'Its life is that of an isolated individual.': 247, 'But\\nwith the suckling and cherishing of young which was distinctive of the new mammalian and avian strains arose\\nthe possibility of learning by imitation, of communication, by warning cries and other concerted action, of mutual\\ncontrol and instruction.': 434, 'A teachable type of life had come into the world.': 773, 'The earliest mammals of the Cainozoic period are but little superior in brain size to the more active carnivorous\\ndinosaurs, but as we read on through the record towards modern times we find, in every tribe and race of theA Short History of the World.': 600, 'The Age of Mammals 12mammalian animals, a steady universal increase in brain capacity.': 97, 'For instance we find at a comparatively early\\nstage that rhinoceroslike beasts appear.': 198, 'There is a creature, the Titanotherium, which lived in the earliest\\ndivision of this period.': 167, 'It was probably very like a modern rhinoceros in its habits and needs.': 248, 'But its brain\\ncapacity was not one tenth that of its living successor.': 327, 'The earlier mammals probably parted from their offspring as soon as suckling was over, but, once the capacity for\\nmutual understanding has arisen, the advantages of continuing the association are very great and we presently\\nfind a number of mammalian species displaying the beginnings of a true social life and keeping together in herds,\\npacks and flocks, watching each other, imitating each other, taking warning from each others acts and cries.': 1265, 'This\\nis something that the world had not seen before among vertebrated animals.': 630, 'Reptiles and fish may no doubt be\\nfound in swarms and shoals they have been hatched in quantities and similar conditions have kept them together,\\nbut in the case of the social and gregarious mammals the association arises not simply from a community of\\nexternal forces, it is sustained by an inner impulse.': 601, 'They are not merely like one another and so found in the same\\nplaces at the same times they like one another and so they keep together.': 1062, 'This difference between the reptile world and the world of our human minds is one our sympathies seem unable to\\npass.': 1436, 'We cannot conceive in ourselves the swift uncomplicated urgency of a reptiles instinctive motives, its\\nappetites, fears and hates.': 45, 'We cannot understand them in their simplicity because all our motives are complicated\\nours are balances and resultants and not simple urgencies.': 50, 'But the mammals and birds have selfrestraint and\\nconsideration for other individuals, a social appeal, a selfcontrol that is, at its lower level, after our own fashion.': 190, 'We can in consequence establish relations with almost all sorts of them.': 76, 'When they suffer they utter cries and\\nmake movements that rouse our feelings.': 76, 'We can make understanding pets of them with a mutual recognition.': 81, 'They can be tamed to selfrestraint towards us, domesticated and taught.': 107, 'That unusual growth of brain which is the central fact of Cainozoic times marks a new communication and\\ninterdependence of individuals.': 425, 'It foreshadows the development of human societies of which we shall soon be\\ntelling.': 261, 'As the Cainozoic period unrolled, the resemblance of its flora and fauna to the plants and animals that inhabit the\\nworld today increased.': 684, 'The big clumsy Uintatheres and Titanotheres, the Entelodonts and Hyracodons, big\\nclumsy brutes like nothing living, disappeared.': 283, 'On the other hand a series of forms led up by steady degrees from\\ngrotesque and clumsy predecessors to the

and extinction of species occurred.': 485, 'A woolly\\nrhinoceros, adapted to a cold climate, and the mammoth, a big woolly cousin of the elephants, the Arctic musk ox\\nand the reindeer passed across the scene.': 158, 'Then century by century the Arctic ice cap, the wintry death of the great\\nIce Age, crept southward.': 928, 'In England it came almost down to the Thames, in America it reached Ohio.': 233, 'There\\nwould be warmer spells of a few thousand years and relapses towards a bitterer cold.': 459, 'Geologists talk of these wintry phases as the First, Second, Third and Fourth Glacial Ages, and of the interludes\\nas Interglacial periods.': 38, 'We live today in a world that is still impoverished and scarred by that terrible winter.': 730, 'The\\nFirst Glacial Age was coming on 600,000 years ago the Fourth Glacial Age reached its bitterest some fifty\\nthousand years ago.': 510, 'And it was amidst the snows of this long universal winter that the first manlike beings lived\\nupon our planet.': 730, 'By the middle Cainozoic period there have appeared various apes with many quasihuman attributes of the jaws\\nand leg bones, but it is only as we approach these Glacial Ages that we find traces of creatures that we can speak\\nof as almost human.': 582, 'These traces are not bones but implements.': 55, 'In Europe, in deposits of this period, between\\nhalf a million and a million years old, we find flints and stones that have evidently been chipped intentionally by\\nsome handy creature desirous of hammering, scraping or fighting with the sharpened edge.': 520, 'These things have\\nbeen called Eoliths dawn stones.': 140, 'In Europe there are no bones nor other remains of the creature which made\\nthese objects, simply the objects themselves.': 262, 'For all the certainty we have it may have been some entirely\\nunhuman but intelligent monkey.': 134, 'But at Trinil in Java, in accumulations of this age, a piece of a skull and various\\nteeth and bones have been found of a sort of ape man, with a brain case bigger than that of any living apes, which\\nseems to have walked erect.': 645, 'This creature is now called Pithecanthropus erectus, the walking ape man, and the\\nlittle trayful of its bones is the only help our imaginations have as yet in figuring to ourselves the makers of the\\nEoliths.': 426, 'It is not until we come to sands that are almost a quarter of a million years old that we find any other particle of a\\nsubhuman being.': 420, 'But there are plenty of implements, and they are steadily improving in quality as we read on\\nthrough the record.': 115, 'They are no longer clumsy Eoliths they are now shapely instruments made with considerable\\nskill.': 255, 'And they are much bigger than the similar implements afterwards made by true man.': 591, 'Then, in a sandpit at\\nHeidelberg, appears a single quasihuman jawbone, a clumsy jawbone, absolutely chinless, far heavier than a\\ntrue human jawbone and narrower, so that it is improbable the creatures tongue could have moved about for\\narticulate speech.': 511, 'On the strength of this jawbone, scientific men suppose this creature to have been a heavy,\\nalmost human monster, possibly with huge limbs and hands, possibly with a thick felt of hair, and they call it the\\nHeidelberg Man.': 567, 'This jawbone is, I think, one of the most tormenting objects in the world to our human curiosity.': 894, 'To see it is like\\nlooking through a defective glass into the past and catching just one blurred and tantalizing glimpse of this Thing,\\nshambling through the bleak wilderness, clambering to avoid the sabretoothed tiger, watching the woolly\\nrhinoceros in the woods.': 478, 'Then before we can scrutinize the monster, he vanishes.': 4, 'Yet the soil is littered\\nabundantly with the indestructible implements he chipped out for his uses.': 42, 'Still more fascinatingly enigmatical are the remains of a creature found at Piltdown in Sussex in a deposit that\\nmay indicate an age between a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand years ago, though some authorities\\nwould put these particular remains back in time to before the Heidelberg jawbone.': 1232, 'Here there are the remains of\\na thick subhuman skull much larger than any existing apes, and a chimpanzeelike jawbone which may or may\\nnot belong to it, and, in addition, a batshaped piece of elephant bone evidently carefully manufactured, through\\nwhich a hole had apparently been bored.': 472, 'There is also the thighbone of a deer with cuts upon it

strangest of all these\\nprecursors of humanity, the Neanderthalers, the men who were almost, but not quite, true men.': 582, 'But it may be well perhaps to state quite clearly here that no scientific man supposes either of these creatures, the\\nHeidelberg Man or Eoanthropus, to be direct ancestors of the men of today.': 825, 'These are, at the closest, related\\nforms.': 32, 'The Neanderthaler

351, 'They were of a different species of the same\\ngenus.': 79, 'They had heavy protruding jaws and great brow ridges above the eyes and very low foreheads.': 473, 'Their\\nthumbs were not opposable to the fingers as mens are their necks were so poised that they could not turn back\\ntheir heads and look up to the sky.': 215, 'They probably slouched along, head down and forward.': 113, 'Their chinless\\njawbones resemble the Heidelberg jawbone and are markedly unlike human jawbones.': 170, 'And there were great\\ndifferences from the human pattern in their teeth.': 618, 'Their cheek teeth were more complicated in structure than ours,\\nmore complicated and not less so they had not the long fangs of our cheek teeth and also these quasimen had\\nnot the marked canines dog teeth of an ordinary human being.': 482, 'The capacity of their skulls was quite human, but\\nthe brain was bigger behind and lower in front than the human brain.': 412, 'Their intellectual faculties were differently\\narranged.': 43, 'They were not ancestral to the human line.': 167, 'Mentally and physically they were upon a different line from\\nthe human line.': 521, 'Skulls and bones of this extinct species of man were found at Neanderthal among other places, and from that\\nplace these strange protomen have been christened Neanderthal Men, or Neanderthalers.': 420, 'They must have\\nendured in Europe for many hundreds or even thousands of years.': 434, 'At that time the climate and geography of our world was very different from what they are at the present time.': 980, 'Europe for example was covered with ice reaching as far south as the Thames and into Central Germany and\\nRussia there was no Channel separating Britain from France the Mediterranean and the Red Sea

reindeer,\\nno doubt following the vegetation northward in spring and southward in autumn.A Short History of the World.': 615, 'The Neanderthaler and the Rhodesian Man 15Such was the scene through which the Neanderthaler wandered, gathering such subsistence as he could from\\nsmall game or fruits and berries and roots.': 205, 'Possibly he was mainly a vegetarian, chewing twigs and roots.': 16, 'His\\nlevel elaborate teeth suggest a largely vegetarian dietary.': 79, 'But we also find the long marrow bones of great animals\\nin his caves, cracked to extract the marrow.': 738, 'His weapons could not have been of much avail in open conflict with\\ngreat beasts, but it is supposed that he attacked them with spears at difficult river crossings and even constructed\\npitfalls for them.': 887, 'Possibly he followed the herds and preyed upon any dead that were killed in fights, and perhaps\\nhe played the part of jackal to the sabretoothed tiger which still survived in his day.': 699, 'Possibly in the bitter\\nhardships of the Glacial Ages this creature had taken to attacking animals after long ages of vegetarian adaptation.': 203, 'We cannot guess what this Neanderthal man looked like.': 304, 'He may have been very hairy and very\\ninhumanlooking indeed.': 146, 'It is even doubtful if he went erect.': 186, 'He may have used his knuckles as well as his feet to\\nhold himself up.': 189, 'Probably he went about alone or in small family groups.': 178, 'It is inferred from the structure of his\\njaw that he was incapable of speech as we understand it.': 45, 'For thousands of years these Neanderthalers were the highest animals that the European area had ever seen and\\nthen some thirty or thirtyfive thousand years ago as the climate grew warmer a race of kindred beings, more\\nintelligent, knowing more, talking and cooperating together, came drifting into the Neanderthalers world from\\nthe south.': 1446, 'They ousted the Neanderthalers from their caves and squatting places they hunted the same food they\\nprobably made war upon their grisly predecessors and killed them off.': 736, 'These newcomers from the south or the\\neastfor at present we do not know their

'So it is our race comes into the Record of the Rocks, and the story of mankind begins.': 155, 'The world was growing liker our own in those days though the climate was still austere.': 794, 'The glaciers of the Ice\\nAge were receding in Europe the reindeer of France and Spain presently gave way to great herds of horses as\\ngrass increased upon the steppes, and the mammoth became more and more rare in southern Europe and finally\\nreceded northward altogether.': 1158, 'We do not know where the True Men first originated.': 291, 'But in the summer of 1921, an extremely interesting

and the human being.': 628, 'The braincase\\nindicates a brain bigger in front and smaller behind than the Neanderthalers, and the skull was poised erect upon\\nthe backbone in a quite human way.': 612, 'The teeth also and the bones are quite human.': 322, 'But the face must have been\\napelike with enormous brow ridges and a ridge along the middle of the skull.': 161, 'The creature was indeed a true\\nman, so to speak, with an apelike, Neanderthaler face.': 296, 'This Rhodesian Man is evidently still closer to real men\\nthan the Neanderthal Man.': 385, 'This Rhodesian skull is probably only the second of what in the end may prove to be a long list of finds of\\nsubhuman species which lived on the earth in the vast interval of time between the beginnings of the Ice Age\\nand the

our present collections of these things are the merest beginnings of the accumulations we may hope for\\nin the future, when there are searchers enough to make a thorough examination of all possible

human beings first made their way\\nacross the land connexion that is now cut by Behring Straits, into the American continent.': 1839, 'These first real human beings we know of in Europe appear already to have belonged to one or other of at least\\ntwo very distinct races.': 967, 'One of these races was of a very high type indeed it was tall and big brained.': 130, 'One of the\\nwomens

Indian.': 30, 'From the CroMagnon cave in\\nwhich the first skeletons were found these people have been called CroMagnards.': 643, 'They were savages, but\\nsavages of a high order.': 77, 'The second race, the race of the Grimaldi cave remains, was distinctly negroid in its\\ncharacters.': 164, 'Its nearest living affinities are the Bushmen and Hottentots of South Africa.': 56, 'It is interesting to find at\\nthe very outset of the known human story, that mankind was already racially divided into at least two main\\nvarieties and one is tempted to such unwarrantable guesses as that the former race was probably brownish rather\\nthan black and that it came from the East or North, and that the latter was blackish rather than brown and came\\nfrom the equatorial south.': 1478, 'And these savages of perhaps forty thousand years ago were so human that they pierced shells to make necklaces,\\npainted themselves, carved images of bone and stone, scratched figures on rocks and bones, and painted rude but\\noften very able sketches of beasts and the like upon the smooth walls of caves and upon inviting rock surfaces.': 1383, 'They made a great variety of implements, much smaller in scale and finer than those of the Neanderthal men.': 1032, 'We\\nhave now in our museums great quantities of their implements, their statuettes, their rock drawings and the like.': 615, 'The earliest of them were hunters.': 33, 'Their chief pursuit was the wild horse, the little bearded pony of that time.': 376, 'They followed it as it moved after pasture.': 62, 'And also they followed the

'They hunted with spears and throwing stones.': 21, 'They do not seem to have had the bow, and it is doubtful if they\\nhad yet learnt to tame any animals.': 158, 'They had no dogs.': 3, 'There is one carving of a horses head and one or two\\ndrawings that suggest a bridled horse, with a twisted skin or tendon round it.': 712, 'But the little horses of that age and\\nregion could not have carried a man, and if the horse was domesticated it was used as a led horse.': 627, 'It is doubtful\\nand improbable that they had yet learnt the rather unnatural use of animals milk as food.': 210, 'They do not seem to have erected any buildings though they may have had tents of skins, and though they made\\nclay figures they never rose to the making of pottery.': 557, 'Since they had no cooking

skin or fur they were naked painted savages.A Short History of the World.': 20, 'The First True Men 17These earliest known men hunted the open steppes of Europe for a hundred centuries perhaps, and then slowly\\ndrifted and changed before a change of climate.': 542, 'Europe, century by century, was growing milder and damper.': 458, 'Reindeer receded northward and eastward, and bison and horse followed.': 99, 'The steppes gave way to forests, and\\nred deer took the place of horse and bison.': 238, 'There is a change in the character of the implements with this change\\nin their

those of later, even historical\\ntimes, down to the Renaissance.': 455, 'The Romans, for example, never had needles comparable to those of this epoch.': 95, 'Almost fifteen or twelve thousand years ago a fresh people drifted into the south of Spain, and left very\\nremarkable drawings of themselves upon exposed rock faces there.': 951, 'These were the Azilians named from the Mas\\ndAzil cave.': 17, 'They had the bow they seem to have worn feather headdresses they drew vividly but also they had\\nreduced their drawings to a sort of symbolisma man for instance would be represented by a

from stimulation and improvement.': 446, 'They seem to have degenerated rather than\\ndeveloped.': 119, 'They lived a base life subsisting upon shellfish and small game.': 623, 'They had no

almost entirely to inference and guesswork in our answers to these\\nquestions.': 460, 'The sources to which scientific men have gone in their attempts to reconstruct that primitive mentality are very\\nvarious.': 376, 'Recently the science of psychoanalysis, which analyzes the way in which the egotistic and passionate\\nimpulses of the child are restrained, suppressed, modified or overlaid, to adapt them to the needs of social life,\\nseems to have thrown a considerable amount of light upon the history of primitive society and another fruitful\\nsource of suggestion has been the study of the ideas and customs of such contemporary savages as still survive.': 1567, 'Again there is a sort of mental fossilization which we find in folklore and the deeplying irrational superstitions\\nand prejudices that still survive among modern civilized people.': 675, 'And finally we have in the increasingly\\nnumerous pictures, statues, carvings, symbols and the like, as we draw near to our own

'Most of the world still lives by imagination and passion.': 668, 'Probably the earliest human societies, in the opening stages of the true human story, were small family groups.': 518, 'Just as the flocks and herds of the earlier mammals arose out of families which remained together and multiplied,\\nso probably did the earliest tribes.': 321, 'But before this could happen a certain restraint upon the primitive egotisms of\\nthe individual had to be established.': 525, 'The fear of the father and respect for the mother had to be extended into adult\\nlife, and the natural jealousy of the old man of the group for the younger males as they grew up had to be\\nmitigated.': 656, 'The mother on the other hand was the natural adviser and protector of the young.': 112, 'Human social life\\ngrew up out of the reaction between the crude instinct of the young to go off and pair by themselves as they grew\\nup, on the one hand, and the dangers and disadvantages of separation on the other.': 744, 'An anthropological writer of\\ngreat genius, J. J. Atkinson, in his Primal Law, has shown how much of the customary law of savages, the Tabus,\\nthat are so remarkable a fact in tribal life, can be ascribed to such a mental adjustment of the needs of the\\nprimitive human animal to a developing social life, and the later work of the psychoanalysts has done much to\\nconfirm his interpretation of these possibilities.': 1742, 'Some speculative writers would have us believe that respect and fear of the Old Man and the emotional reaction\\nof the primitive savage to older protective women, exaggerated in dreams and enriched by fanciful mental play,\\nplayed a large part in the beginnings of primitive religion and in the conception of gods and goddesses.': 667, 'Associated with this respect for powerful or helpful personalities was a dread and exaltation of such personages\\nafter their deaths, due to their reappearance in dreams.': 57, 'It was easy to believe they were not truly dead but only\\nfantastically transferred to a remoteness of greater power.': 200, 'The dreams, imaginations and fears of a child are far more vivid and real than those of a modern adult, and\\nprimitive man was always something of a child.': 501, 'He was nearer to the animals also, and he could suppose them to\\nhave motives and reactions like his own.': 365, 'He could imagine animal helpers, animal enemies, animal gods.': 205, 'One\\nneeds to have been an imaginative child oneself to realize again how important, significant, portentous or friendly,\\nstrangely shaped rocks, lumps of wood, exceptional trees or the like may have appeared to the men of the Old\\nStone Age, and how dream and fancy would create stories and legends about such things that would become\\ncredible as they told them.': 1106, 'Some of these stories would be good enough to remember and tell again.': 275, 'The women\\nwould tell them to the children and so establish a tradition.': 271, 'To this day most imaginative children invent long\\nstories in which some favourite doll or animal or some fantastic semihuman being figures as the hero, and\\nprimitive man probably did the samewith a much stronger disposition to believe his hero real.': 642, 'For the very earliest of the true men that we know of were probably quite talkative beings.': 415, 'In that way they have\\ndiffered from the Neanderthalers and had an advantage over them.': 80, 'The Neanderthaler may have been a dumb\\nanimal.': 125, 'Of course the primitive human speech was probably a very scanty collection of names, and may have\\nbeen eked out with gestures and signs.': 423, 'There is no sort of savage so low as not to have a kind of science of cause and effect.': 179, 'But primitive man was not\\nvery critical in his associations of cause with effect he very easily connected an effect with something quite\\nwrong as its cause.': 379, 'You do so and so, he said, and so and so happens.': 30, 'You give a child a poisonous berry and\\nit dies.': 33, 'You eat the heart of a valiant enemy and you become strong.': 84, 'There we have two bits of cause and effect\\nassociation, one true one false.': 686, 'We call the system of cause and effect in the mind of a savage, Fetish but Fetish is\\nsimply savage science.': 252, 'It differs from modern science in that it is totally unsystematic and uncritical and so more\\nfrequently wrong.': 115, 'In many cases it is not difficult to link cause and effect, in many others erroneous ideas were soon corrected by\\nexperience but there was a large series of issues of very great importance to primitive man, where he sought\\npersistently for causes and found explanations that were wrong but not sufficiently wrong nor so obviously wrong\\nas to be detected.': 1294, 'It was a matter of great importance to him that game should be abundant or fish plentiful andA Short History of the World.': 522, 'Primitive Thought 19easily caught, and no doubt he tried and believed in a thousand charms, incantations and omens to

were stricken by illness and died or were enfeebled without any\\nmanifest cause.': 314, 'This too must have given the hasty, emotional mind of primitive man much feverish exercise.': 512, 'Dreams and fantastic guesses made him blame this, or appeal for help to that man or beast or thing.': 452, 'He had the\\nchilds aptitude for fear and panic.': 20, 'Quite early in the little human tribe, older,

eastward, somewhere in North\\nAfrica or Western Asia or in that great Mediterranean valley that is now submerged under the waters of the\\nMediterranean sea, there were people who, age by age, were working out two vitally important things they were\\nbeginning cultivation and they were domesticating animals.': 1729, 'They were also beginning to make, in addition to the\\nchipped implements of their hunter forebears, implements of polished stone.': 268, 'They had discovered the possibility\\nof basketwork and roughly woven textiles of plant fibre, and they were beginning to make a rudely modelled\\npottery.': 150, 'They were entering upon a new phase in human culture, the Neolithic phase New Stone Age as distinguished\\nfrom the Palaeolithic Old Stone phase of the CroMagnards, the Grimaldi people, the Azilians and their like.': 1180, 'Slowly these Neolithic people spread over the warmer parts of the world and the arts they had mastered, the\\nplants and animals they had learnt to use, spread by imitation and acquisition even more widely than they did.': 1047, 'By\\n10,000 B.C., most of mankind was at the Neolithic level.': 74, 'Now the ploughing of land, the sowing of seed, the reaping of harvest, threshing and grinding, may seem the most\\nobviously reasonable steps to a modern mind just as to a modern mind it is a commonplace that the world is\\nround.': 1003, 'What else could you do people will ask.': 330, 'What else can it be But to the primitive man of twenty thousand\\nyears ago neither of the systems of action and reasoning that seem so sure and manifest to

before he sowed.': 2, 'And it is a very remarkable thing that throughout the world wherever there is sowing and harvesting there is still\\ntraceable the vestiges of a strong primitive association of the idea of sowing with the idea of a blood sacrifice, and\\nprimarily of the sacrifice of a human being.': 1144, 'The study of the original entanglement of these two things is a\\nprofoundly attractive one to the curious mind the interested reader will find it very fully developed in that\\nmonumental work, Sir J. G.

to\\n20,000 years ago, it would seem that whenever seed time came round to the Neolithic peoples there was a human\\nsacrifice.': 1554, 'And it was not the sacrifice of any mean or outcast person it was the sacrifice usually of a chosen youthA Short History of the World.': 55, 'The Beginnings of Cultivation 20or maiden, a youth more often who was treated with profound deference and even worship up to the moment of\\nhis immolation.': 149, 'He was a sort of sacrificial godking, and all the details of his killing had become a ritual directed\\nby the old, knowing men and sanctioned by the accumulated usage of ages.': 444, 'At first primitive men, with only a very rough idea of the seasons, must have found great difficulty in determining\\nwhen was the propitious moment for the seedtime sacrifice and the sowing.': 1188, 'There is some reason for supposing\\nthat there was an early stage in human experience when men had no idea of a year.': 536, 'The first chronology was in\\nlunar months it is supposed that the years of the Biblical patriarchs are really moons, and the Babylonian calendar\\nshows distinct traces of an attempt to reckon seed time by taking thirteen lunar months to see it round.': 818, 'This lunar\\ninfluence upon the calendar reaches down to our own days.': 383, 'If usage did not dull our sense of its strangeness we\\nshould think it a very remarkable thing indeed that the Christian Church does not commemorate the Crucifixion\\nand Resurrection of Christ on the proper anniversaries but on dates that vary year by year with the phases of the\\nmoon.': 239, 'It may be doubted whether the first agriculturalists made any observation of the stars.': 585, 'It is more likely that stars\\nwere first observed by migratory herdsmen, who found them a convenient mark of direction.': 402, 'But once their use in\\ndetermining seasons was realized, their importance to agriculture became very great.': 631, 'The seedtime sacrifice was\\nlinked up with the southing or northing of some prominent star.': 38, 'A myth and worship of that star was for primitive\\nman an almost inevitable consequence.': 298, 'It is easy to see how important the man of knowledge and experience, the man who knew about the blood\\nsacrifice and the stars, became in this early Neolithic world.': 1164, 'The fear of uncleanness and pollution, and the methods of cleansing that were advisable, constituted another\\nsource of power for the knowledgeable men and women.': 459, 'For there have always been witches as well as wizards,\\nand priestesses as well as priests.': 124, 'The early priest was really not so much a religious man as a man of applied\\nscience.': 687, 'His science was generally empirical and often bad he kept it secret from the generality of men very\\njealously but that does not alter the fact that his primary function was knowledge and that his primary use was a\\npractical use.': 511, 'Twelve or fifteen thousand years ago, in all the warm and fairly wellwatered parts of the Old World these\\nNeolithic human communities, with their class and tradition of priests and priestesses and their cultivated fields\\nand their development of villages and little walled cities, were spreading.': 812, 'Age by age a drift and exchange of\\nideas went on between these communities.': 324, 'Eliot Smith and Rivers have used the term Heliolithic culture for the\\nculture of these first agricultural peoples.': 442, 'Heliolithic Sun and Stone is not perhaps the best possible word to\\nuse for this, but until scientific men give us a better one we shall have to use it.': 735, 'Originating somewhere in the\\nMediterranean and western Asiatic area, it spread age by age eastward and from island to island across the Pacific\\nuntil it may even have reached America and mingled with the more primitive ways of living of the Mongoloid\\nimmigrants coming down from the North.': 840, 'Wherever the brownish people with the Heliolithic culture went they took with them all or most of a certain group\\nof curious ideas and practices.': 546, 'Some of them are such queer ideas that they call for the explanation of the mental\\nexpert.': 125, 'They made pyramids and great mounds, and set up great circles of big stones, perhaps to facilitate the\\nastronomical observation of the priests they made mummies of some or all of their dead they tattooed and\\ncircumcized they had the old custom, known as the couvade, of sending the father to bed and rest when a child\\nwas born, and they had as a luck symbol the wellknown Swastika.': 1698, 'If we

its general outline to that of the world\\ntoday.': 1087, 'It is probable that by that time the great barrier across the Straits of Gibraltar that had hitherto banked\\nback the ocean waters from the Mediterranean valley had been eaten through, and that the Mediterranean was a\\nsea following much the same coastlines as it does now.': 1034, 'The Caspian Sea was probably still far more extensive\\nthan it is at present, and it may have been continuous with the Black Sea to the north of the Caucasus Mountains.': 560, 'About this great Central Asian sea lands that are now steppes and deserts were fertile and habitable.': 584, 'Generally it\\nwas a moister and more fertile world.': 483, 'European Russia was much more a land of swamp and lake than it is now,\\nand there may still have been a land connexion between Asia and America at Behring Straits.': 566, 'It would have been already possible at that time to have distinguished the main racial divisions of mankind as we\\nknow them today.': 656, 'Across the warm temperate regions of this rather warmer and betterwooded world, and along\\nthe coasts, stretched the brownish peoples of the Heliolithic culture, the ancestors of the bulk of the living\\ninhabitants of the Mediterranean world, of the Berbers, the Egyptians and of much of the population of South and\\nEastern Asia.': 1467, 'This great race had of course a number of varieties.': 555, 'The Iberian or Mediterranean or darkwhite\\nrace of the Atlantic and Mediterranean coast, the Hamitic peoples which include the Berbers and Egyptians, the\\nDravidians, the darker people of India, a multitude of East Indian people, many Polynesian races and the Maoris\\nare all divisions of various value of this great main mass of humanity.': 1302, 'Its western varieties are whiter than its\\neastern.': 94, 'In the forests of central and northern Europe a more blonde variety of men with blue eyes was becoming\\ndistinguishable, branching off from the main mass of brownish people, a variety which many people now speak of\\nas the Nordic race.': 1016, 'In the more open regions of northeastern Asia was another differentiation of this brownish\\nhumanity in the direction of a type with more oblique eyes, high cheekbones, a yellowish skin, and very straight\\nblack hair, the Mongolian peoples.': 337, 'In South Africa, Australia, in many tropical islands in the south of Asia were\\nremains of the early negroid peoples.': 399, 'The central parts of Africa were already a region of racial intermixture.': 163, 'Nearly all the coloured races of Africa today seem to be blends of the brownish peoples of the north with a\\nnegroid substratum.': 323, 'We have to remember that human races can all interbreed freely and that they separate, mingle and reunite as\\nclouds do.': 192, 'Human races do not branch out like trees with branches that never come together again.': 333, 'It is a thing we\\nneed to bear constantly in mind, this remingling

most\\npreposterous generalizations upon it.': 391, 'They will speak of a British race or of a European race.': 94, 'But nearly all\\nthe European nations are confused mixtures of brownish, darkwhite, white and Mongolian elements.': 82, 'It was at the Neolithic phase of human development that peoples of the Mongolian breed first made their way into\\nAmerica.': 864, 'Apparently they came by way of Behring Straits and spread southward.': 288, 'They found caribou, the\\nAmerican reindeer, in the north and great herds of bison in the south.': 715, 'When they reached South America there\\nwere still living the Glyptodon, a gigantic armadillo, and the Megatherium, a monstrous clumsy sloth as high as\\nan elephant.': 303, 'They probably exterminated the latter beast, which was as helpless as it was big.': 107, 'The greater portion of these American tribes never rose above a hunting nomadic Neolithic life.': 408, 'They never\\ndiscovered the use of iron, and their chief metal possessions were native gold and copper.': 247, 'But in Mexico, Yucatan\\nand Peru conditions existed favourable to settled cultivation, and here about 1000 B.C.': 109, 'or so arose very interesting\\ncivilizations of a parallel but different type from the oldworld civilization.': 238, 'Like the much earlier primitive\\ncivilizations of the old world these communities displayed a

elaborate character.': 110, 'So far as we have been able to decipher it, it was used mainly for keeping the\\nexact and complicated calendars upon which the priests expended their intelligence.': 557, 'The art of the Maya\\ncivilization came to a climax about 700 or 800 A.D.': 233, 'The sculptured work of these people amazes the modern\\nobserver by its great plastic power and its frequent beauty,

nearest approach, and that is a remote one, is found in archaic Indian carvings.': 350, 'Everywhere there are woven\\nfeathers and serpents twine in and out.': 14, 'Many Maya inscriptions resemble a certain sort of elaborate drawing made\\nby lunatics in European asylums, more than any other oldworld work.': 374, 'It is as if the Maya mind had developed\\nupon a different line from the oldworld mind, had a different twist to its ideas, was not, by oldworld standards,\\na rational mind at all.': 747, 'This linking of these aberrant American civilizations to the idea of a general mental aberration finds support in\\ntheir extraordinary obsession by the shedding of human blood.': 355, 'The Mexican civilization in particular ran blood it\\noffered thousands of human victims yearly.': 257, 'The cutting open of living victims, the tearing out of the still beating\\nheart, was an act that dominated the minds and lives of these strange priesthoods.': 349, 'The public life, the national\\nfestivities all turned on this fantastically horrible act.': 321, 'The ordinary existence of the common people in these communities was very like the ordinary existence of any\\nother barbaric peasantry.': 574, 'Their pottery, weaving and dyeing was very good.': 40, 'The Maya writing was not only\\ncarven on stone but written and painted upon skins and the like.': 485, 'The European and American museums contain\\nmany enigmatical Maya manuscripts of which at present little has been deciphered except the dates.': 261, 'In Peru there\\nwere beginnings of a similar writing but they were superseded by a method of keeping records by knotting cords.': 118, 'A similar method of mnemonics was in use in China thousands of years ago.': 289, 'In the old world before 4000 or 5000 B.C., that is to say three or four thousand years earlier, there were primitive\\ncivilizations not unlike these American civilizations civilizations based upon a temple, having a vast quantity of\\nblood sacrifices and with an intensely astronomical priesthood.': 1508, 'But in the old world the primitive civilizations\\nreacted upon one another and developed towards the conditions of our

'Sumeria, Early Egypt and Writing\\nTHE OLD world is a wider, more varied stage than the new.': 784, 'By 6000 or 7000 B.C.': 4, 'there were already\\nquasicivilized communities almost at the Peruvian

and shields of skin.': 87, 'Their clothing was of wool and they\\nshaved their heads.': 18, 'Each of the Sumerian cities seems generally to have been an independent state with a god of its own and priests of\\nits own.': 345, 'But sometimes one city would establish an ascendancy over others and exact tribute from their\\npopulation.': 617, 'A very ancient inscription at Nippur records the empire, the first recorded empire, of the Sumerian\\ncity of Erech.': 868, 'Its god and its priestking claimed an authority from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea.': 105, 'At first writing was merely an

indicated men by a vertical and one or two\\ntransverse strokes.': 768, 'From this to a conventional condensed picture writing was an easy transition.': 56, 'In Sumeria,\\nwhere the writing was done on clay with a stick, the dabs of the characters soon became unrecognizably unlike\\nthe things they stood for, but in Egypt where men painted on walls and on strips of the papyrus reed the

be conveyed by\\npictures directly.': 696, 'Egyptian writing underwent parallel developments.': 64, 'Later on, when foreign peoples with less\\ndistinctly syllabled methods of speech were to learn and use these picture scripts they were to make those further\\nmodifications and simplifications that developed at last into alphabetical writing.': 491, 'All the true alphabets of the later\\nworld derived from a mixture of the Sumerian cuneiform and the Egyptian hieroglyphic priest writing.': 643, 'Later in\\nChina there was to develop a conventionalized picture writing, but in China it never

years.': 170, 'Sometimes he was ambitious and took mens sons to be soldiers and sent them against neighbouring city states to\\nwar and plunder, or he made them toil to build great buildings.': 1078,

B.C.': 484, 'Wherever there were possibilities of irrigation and a\\nsteady alltheyearround food supply men were exchanging the uncertainties and hardships of hunting and\\nwandering for the routines of settlement.': 295, 'On the upper Tigris a people called the Assyrians were founding cities\\nin the valleys of Asia Minor and on the Mediterranean shores and islands, there were small communities growing\\nup to civilization.': 578, 'Possibly parallel developments of human life were already going on in favourable regions of\\nIndia and China.': 528, 'In many parts of Europe where there were lakes well stocked with fish, little communities of\\nmen had long settled in dwellings built on piles over the water, and were eking out agriculture by fishing and\\nhunting.': 653, 'But over much larger areas of the old world no such settlement was possible.': 779, 'The land was too harsh, too\\nthickly wooded or too arid, or the seasons too uncertain for mankind, with only the implements and science of that\\nage to take root.': 380, 'For settlement under the conditions of the primitive civilizations men needed a constant water supply and warmth\\nand sunshine.': 433, 'Where these needs were not satisfied, man could live as a transient, as a hunter following his game,\\nas a herdsman following the seasonal grass, but he could not settle.': 418, 'The transition from the hunting to the herding\\nlife may have been very gradual.': 348, 'From following herds of wild cattle or in Asia wild horses, men may have\\ncome to an idea of property in them, have learnt to pen them into valleys, have fought for them against wolves,\\nwild dogs and other predatory beasts.': 592, 'So while the primitive civilizations of the cultivators were growing up chiefly in the great river valleys, a different\\nway of living, the nomadic life, a life in constant movement to and fro from winter pasture to summer pasture,\\nwas also growing up.': 1467, 'The nomadic peoples were on the whole hardier than the agriculturalists they were less\\nprolific and numerous, they had no permanent temples and no highly organized priesthood they had less gear but\\nthe reader must not suppose that theirs was necessarily a less highly developed way of living on that account.': 637, 'In\\nmany ways this free life was a fuller life than that of the tillers of the soil.': 616, 'The individual was more

and treat for pasture with\\ncompeting tribes.': 68, 'He knew more of minerals than the folk upon the plough lands because he went over mountain\\npasses and into rocky places.': 451, 'He may have been a better metallurgist.': 125, 'Possibly bronze and much more probably\\niron smelting were nomadic discoveries.': 246, 'Some of the earliest implements of iron reduced from its ores have been\\nfound in Central Europe far away from the early civilizations.': 425, 'On the other hand the settled folk had their textiles and their pottery and made many desirable things.': 426, 'It was\\ninevitable that as the two sorts of life, the agricultural and the nomadic differentiated, a certain amount of looting\\nand trading should develop between the two.': 606, 'In Sumeria particularly which had deserts and seasonal country on\\neither hand it must have been usual to have the nomads camping close to the cultivated fields, trading and stealing\\nand perhaps tinkering, as

'The empire he founded decayed after two centuries, and after one inundation of Elamites a fresh Semitic\\npeople, the Amorites, by degrees established their rule over Sumeria.': 1021, 'They made

where they had to do so.': 667, 'The seas on which these first ships adventured were inland seas on which the wind blew fitfully and which were\\noften at a dead calm for days together, so that

after them and industrial slaves to make a profit for them.': 225, 'Life must have seemed very secure in Cnossos for such people, sunlit and girdled by the blue sea.': 419, 'Egypt of course\\nmust have appeared rather a declining country in those days under the rule of her halfbarbaric shepherd kings,\\nand if one took an interest in politics one must have noticed how the Semitic people seemed

on those distant coasts.': 1435, 'There were some active and curious minds in Cnossos, because later on the Greeks told legends of a certain\\nskilful Cretan artificer, Daedalus, who attempted to make some sort of flying machine, perhaps a glider, which\\ncollapsed and fell into the sea.': 474, 'It is interesting to note some of the differences as well as the resemblances between the life of Cnossos and our\\nown.': 307, 'To a Cretan gentleman of 2500 B.C.': 8, 'iron was a rare metal which fell out of the sky and was curious rather\\nthan usefulfor as yet only meteoric iron was known,

went down to the harbour and saw a captive who attracted his attention because he was very\\nfaircomplexioned and had blue eyes.': 455, 'Perhaps our Cretan tried to talk to him and was answered in an\\nunintelligible gibberish.': 33, 'This creature came from somewhere beyond the Black Sea and seemed to be an\\naltogether benighted savage.': 306, 'But indeed he was an Aryan tribesman, of a race

and making it over\\nfor their own purposes in Italy and Greece and north Persia.': 353, 'The theme of history from the ninth century B.C.': 509, 'onward for six centuries is the story of how these Aryan peoples grew to power and enterprise and how at last\\nthey subjugated the whole Ancient World, Semitic, aegean and Egyptian alike.': 653, 'In form the Aryan peoples were\\naltogether victorious but the struggle of Aryan, Semitic and Egyptian ideas and methods was continued long after\\nthe sceptre was in Aryan hands.': 457, 'It is indeed a struggle that goes on through all the rest of

military power under Tiglath Pileser III and under the\\nusurper Sargon II.': 793, 'Sargon was not this mans original name he adopted it to flatter the conquered Babylonians by\\nreminding them of that ancient founder of the Akkadian Empire, Sargon I, two thousand years before his time.': 682, 'Babylon, for all that it was a conquered city, was of greater population and importance than Nineveh, and its great\\ngod Bel Marduk and its traders and priests had to be treated politely.': 806, 'In Mesopotamia in the eighth century B.C.': 220, 'we are already far beyond the barbaric days when the capture of a town meant loot and massacre.': 350, 'Conquerors\\nsought to propitiate and win the conquered.': 67, 'For a century and a half after Sargon the new Assyrian empire\\nendured and, as we have noted, Assurbanipal Sardanapalus held at least lower Egypt.': 836, 'But the power and solidarity of Assyria waned rapidly.': 151, 'Egypt by an effort threw off the foreigner under a Pharoah\\nPsammetichus I, and under Necho II attempted a war of conquest in Syria.': 189, 'By that time Assyria was grappling\\nwith foes nearer at hand, and could make but a poor resistance.': 406, 'A Semitic people from southeast Mesopotamia,\\nthe Chaldeans, combined with Aryan Medes and Persians from the northeast against Nineveh, and in 606\\nB.C.for now we are coming down to exact chronologytook that city.': 372, 'There was a division of the spoils of Assyria.': 22, 'A Median Empire was set up in the north under Cyaxares.': 165, 'It\\nincluded Nineveh, and its capital was Ecbatana.': 23, 'Eastward it reached to the borders of India.': 46, 'To the south of this in\\na great crescent was a new Chaldean Empire, the Second Babylonian Empire, which rose to a very great degree of\\nwealth and power under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar the Great the Nebuchadnezzar of the Bible.': 1442, 'The last great\\ndays, the greatest days of all, for Babylon began.': 779, 'For a time the two Empires remained at peace, and the daughter\\nof Nebuchadnezzar was married to Cyaxares.': 449, 'Meanwhile Necho II was pursuing his easy conquests in Syria.': 33, 'He had defeated and slain King Josiah of Judah, a\\nsmall country of which there is more to tell presently, at the battle of Megiddo in 608 B.C., and he pushed on to\\nthe Euphrates to encounter not a decadent Assyria but a renascent Babylonia.': 295, 'The Chaldeans dealt very\\nvigorously with the Egyptians.': 5, 'Necho was routed and driven back to Egypt, and the Babylonian frontier pushed\\ndown to the ancient Egyptian boundaries.': 154, 'From 606 until 539 B.C.': 3, 'the Second Babylonian Empire flourished insecurely.': 17, 'It flourished so long as it kept the\\npeace with the stronger, hardier Median Empire to the north.': 286, 'And during these sixtyseven years not only life but\\nlearning flourished in the ancient city.': 552, 'Even under the Assyrian monarchs and especially under Sardanapalus, Babylon had been a scene of great\\nintellectual activity.': 527, 'Sardanapalus, though an Assyrian, had been quite Babylonized.': 83, 'He made a library, a library\\nnot of paper but of the clay tablets that were used for writing in Mesopotamia since early Sumerian days.': 454, 'His\\ncollection has been unearthed and is perhaps the most precious store of historical material in the world.': 547, 'The last of\\nthe Chaldean line of Babylonian monarchs, Nabonidus, had even keener literary tastes.': 224, 'He patronized antiquarian\\nresearches, and when a date was worked out by his investigators for the accession of Sargon I he commemorated\\nthe fact by inscriptions.': 52, 'But there were many signs of disunion in his empire, and he sought to centralize it by\\nbringing a number of the various local gods to Babylon and setting up temples to them there.': 538, 'This device was to\\nbe practised quite successfully by the Romans in later times, but in Babylon it roused the jealousy of the powerful\\npriesthood of Bel Marduk, the dominant god of the Babylonians.': 250, 'They cast about for a possible alternative to\\nNabonidus and found it in Cyrus the Persian, the ruler of the adjacent Median Empire.': 146, 'Cyrus had already\\ndistinguished himself by conquering Croesus, the rich king of Lydia in Eastern Asia Minor.': 200, 'He came up against\\nBabylon, there was a battle outside the walls, and the gates of the city were opened to him 538 B.C.. His soldiers\\nentered the city without fighting.': 470, 'The crown prince Belshazzar, the son of Nabonidus, was feasting, the Bible\\nrelates, when a hand appeared and wrote in letters of fire upon the wall these mystical words Mene, Mene,\\nTekel, Upharsin, which was interpreted by the prophet Daniel, whom he summoned to read the riddle, as GodA Short History of the World.': 497, 'The Last Babylonian Empire and the Empire of Darius I 33has numbered thy kingdom and finished it thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting and thy kingdom is\\ngiven to the Medes and Persians.': 251, 'Possibly the priests of Bel Marduk knew something about that writing on the\\nwall.': 124, 'Belshazzar was killed that night, says the Bible.': 41, 'Nabonidus was taken prisoner, and the occupation of the\\ncity was so peaceful that the services of Bel Marduk continued without intermission.': 177, 'Thus it was the Babylonian and Median empires were united.': 96, 'Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, subjugated Egypt.': 42, 'Cambyses went mad and was accidentally killed, and was presently succeeded by Darius the Mede, Darius I, the\\nson of Hystaspes, one of the chief councillors of Cyrus.': 479, 'The Persian Empire of Darius I, the first of the new Aryan empires in the seat of the old civilizations, was the\\ngreatest empire the world had hitherto seen.': 1464, 'It included all Asia Minor and Syria, all the old Assyrian and\\nBabylonian empires, Egypt, the Caucasus and Caspian regions, Media, Persia, and it extended into India as far as\\nthe Indus.': 287, 'Such an empire was possible because the horse and rider and the chariot and the maderoad had now\\nbeen brought into the world.': 813, 'Hitherto the ass and ox and the camel for desert use had afforded the swiftest method\\nof transport.': 91, 'Great arterial roads were made by the Persian rulers to hold their new empire, and post horses were\\nalways in waiting for the imperial messenger or the traveller with an official permit.': 799, 'Moreover the world was now\\nbeginning to use coined money, which greatly facilitated trade and intercourse.': 626, 'But the capital of this vast empire\\nwas no longer Babylon.': 312, 'In the long run the priesthood of Bel Marduk gained nothing by their treason.': 135, 'Babylon\\nthough still important was now a declining city, and the great cities of the new empire were Persepolis and Susa\\nand Ecbatana.': 1313, 'The capital was Susa.': 17, 'Nineveh was already abandoned and sinking into ruins.': 101, 'The Early History of the Jews\\nAND now we can tell of the Hebrews, a Semitic people, not so important in their own time as in their influence\\nupon the later history of the world.': 1615, 'They were settled in Judea long before 1000 B.C., and their capital city after\\nthat time was Jerusalem.': 415, 'Their story is interwoven with that of the great empires on either side of them, Egypt to\\nthe south and the changing empires of Syria, Assyria and Babylon to the north.': 808, 'Their country was an inevitable\\nhigh road between these latter powers and Egypt.': 160, 'Their importance in the world is due to the fact that they produced a written literature, a world history, a\\ncollection of laws, chronicles, psalms, books of wisdom, poetry and fiction and political utterances which became\\nat last what Christians know as the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible.': 1768, 'This literature appears in history in the\\nfourth or fifth century B.C.': 562, 'Probably this literature was first put together in Babylon.': 369, 'We have already told how the Pharaoh, Necho II,\\ninvaded the Assyrian Empire while Assyria was fighting for life against Medes, Persians and Chaldeans.': 367, 'Josiah\\nKing of Judah opposed him, and was defeated and slain at Megiddo 608 B.C.. Judah became a tributary to\\nEgypt, and when Nebuchadnezzar the Great, the new Chaldean king in Babylon, rolled back Necho into Egypt, he\\nattempted to manage Judah by setting up puppet kings in Jerusalem.': 622, 'The experiment failed, the people massacred\\nhis Babylonian officials, and he then determined to break up this little state altogether, which had long been\\nplaying off Egypt against the northern empire.': 860, 'Jerusalem was sacked and burnt, and the remnant of the people\\nwas carried off captive to Babylon.': 295, 'There they remained until Cyrus took Babylon 538 B.C..': 101, 'He then collected them together and sent them back to\\nresettle their country and rebuild the walls and temple of Jerusalem.': 230, 'Before that time the Jews do not seem to have been a

parallels.': 12, 'But with\\nthe story of Abraham and onward begins something more special to the Jewish race.': 153, 'Abraham may have lived as early as the days of Hammurabi in Babylon.': 280, 'He was a patriarchal Semitic nomad.': 4, 'To\\nthe book of Genesis the reader must go for the story of his wanderings and for the stories of his sons and\\ngrandchildren and how they became captive in the Land of Egypt.': 300, 'He travelled through Canaan, and the God of\\nAbraham, says the Bible story, promised this smiling land of prosperous cities to him and to his children.': 246, 'And after a long sojourn in Egypt and after fifty years of wandering in the wilderness under the leadership of\\nMoses, the children of Abraham, grown now to a host of twelve tribes, invaded the land of Canaan

help out the story.': 270, 'But at any rate they did not succeed in\\nconquering any more than the hilly backgrounds of the promised land.': 102, 'The coast was now in the hands, not of the\\nCanaanites but of newcomers, those aegean peoples, the Philistines and their cities, Gaza, Gath, Ashdod, Ascalon\\nand Joppa successfully withstood the Hebrew attack.': 274, 'For many generations the children of Abraham remained an\\nobscure people of the hilly back country engaged in incessant bickerings with the Philistines and with the kindred\\ntribes about them, the Moabites, the Midianites and so forth.': 611, 'The reader will find in the book of Judges a record of\\ntheir struggles and disasters during this period.': 202, 'For very largely it is a record of disasters and

Phoenician trade went to the Red Sea by Egypt, but Egypt\\nwas in a state of profound disorder at this time there may have been other obstructions to Phoenician trade along\\nthis line, and at any

say that\\nit was added to and exaggerated by the patriotic pride of later writers.': 101, 'But the Bible account read carefully is not\\nso overwhelming as it appears at the first reading.': 318, 'Solomons temple, if one works out the measurements, would\\ngo inside a small suburban church, and his fourteen hundred chariots cease to impress us when we learn from an\\nAssyrian monument that his

be\\ndetails open to criticism in the Bible story of Hebrew history from the days of the Judges onward, but on the\\nwhole it is evidently a true story which squares with all that has been learnt in

182, 'In the time of the Pharaoh Necho, a\\nPhoenician expedition sailed completely round Africa.': 271, 'At that time the Aryan peoples were still barbarians.': 482, 'Only the Greeks were reconstructing a new civilization of the\\nruins of the one they had destroyed, and the Medes were becoming formidable, as an Assyrian inscription calls\\nthem, in central Asia.': 688, 'In 800 B.C.':

civilized Semites who were beaten and overrun in these five eventful centuries one people only\\nheld together and clung to its ancient traditions and that was little people, the Jews, who were sent back to build\\ntheir city of Jerusalem by Cyrus the Persian.': 1267, 'And they were able to do this, because they had got together this\\nliterature of theirs, their Bible, in Babylon.': 119, 'It is

36Foremost of these Jewish ideas was this, that their God was invisible and remote, an invisible God in a temple not\\nmade with hands, a Lord of Righteousness throughout the earth.': 450, 'All other peoples had national gods embodied in\\nimages that lived in temples.': 232, 'If the image was smashed and the temple razed, presently that god died out.': 206, 'But this\\nwas a new idea, this God of

Sumerians and Egyptians began to turn their hieroglyphics into writing.': 245, 'The Jews were a new\\nthing, a people without a king and presently without a temple for as we shall tell Jerusalem itself was broken up\\nin 70 A.D., held together and consolidated out of heterogeneous elements by nothing but the power of the written\\nword.': 1178, 'And this mental welding of the Jews was neither planned nor foreseen nor done by either priests or statesmen.': 155, 'Not\\nonly a new kind of community but a new kind of man comes into history with the development of the Jews.': 1113, 'In the\\ndays of Solomon the Hebrews looked like becoming a little people just like any other little people of that time\\nclustering around court and temple, ruled by the wisdom of the priest and led by

Egypt, that broken reed, or against Assyria or Babylon\\nthey denounced the indolence of the priestly order or the flagrant sins of the King.': 307, 'Some of them turned their\\nattention to what we should now call social reform.': 146, 'The rich were grinding the faces of the poor, the luxurious\\nwere consuming the childrens bread wealthy people made friends with and imitated the splendours and vices of\\nforeigners and this was hateful to Jehovah, the God of Abraham, who would certainly punish this land.': 766, 'These fulminations were written down and preserved and studied.': 27, 'They went wherever the Jews went, and\\nwherever they went they spread a new religious spirit.': 699, 'They carried the common man past priest and temple, past\\ncourt and king and brought him face to face with the Rule of Righteousness.': 596, 'That is their supreme importance in\\nthe history of mankind.': 372, 'In the great utterances of Isaiah the prophetic voice rises to a pitch of

a\\nlong adventure story of the return of the sage captain, Odysseus, from Troy to his own island.': 1264, 'These epics were\\nwritten down somewhen in the eighth or seventh century B.C., when the Greeks had acquired the use of an\\nalphabet from their more civilized neighbours, but they are supposed to have been in existence very much earlier.': 543, 'Formerly they were ascribed to a particular blind bard, Homer, who was supposed to have sat down and\\ncomposed them as Milton composed Paradise Lost.': 39, 'Whether there really was such a poet, whether he composed\\nor only wrote down and polished these epics and so forth, is a favourite quarrelling ground for the erudite.': 79, 'We\\nneed not concern ourselves with such bickerings here.': 15, 'The thing that matters from our point of view is that the\\nGreeks were in possession of their epics in the eighth century B.C., and that they were a common possession and\\na link between their various tribes, giving them a sense of fellowship as against the outer barbarians.': 575, 'They were a\\ngroup of kindred peoples linked by the spoken and afterwards by the written word, and sharing common ideals of\\ncourage and behaviour.': 269, 'The epics showed the Greeks a barbaric people without iron, without writing, and still not living in cities.': 710, 'They\\nseem to have lived at first in open villages of huts around the halls of their chiefs outside the ruins of the aegean\\ncities they had destroyed.': 538, 'Then they began to wall their cities and to adopt the idea of temples from the people\\nthey had

Athens.': 76, 'For over thirty years 466 to 428 B.C.': 173, 'Athens was\\ndominated by a man of great vigour and liberality of mind, Pericles, who set himself to rebuild the city from the\\nashes to which the Persians had reduced it.': 862, 'The beautiful ruins that still glorify Athens today are chiefly the\\nremains of this great effort.': 730, 'And he did not simply rebuild a material Athens.': 41, 'He rebuilt Athens intellectually.': 6, 'He\\ngathered about him not only architects and sculptors but poets, dramatists, philosophers and teachers.': 38, 'Herodotus\\ncame to Athens to

Anaxagoras came with the beginnings of a scientific description\\nof the sun and stars.': 704, 'aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides one after the other carried the Greek drama to its highest\\nlevels

mens minds.': 443, 'Already long before the time of Pericles the peculiar freedom of Greek institutions had given great importance to\\nskill in discussion.': 820, 'Decision rested neither with king

divisions, an examination of the foundations and methods of\\nhuman thinking and an examination of political institutions.': 538, 'He was the first man to write a Utopia, that is to say\\nthe plan of a community different from and better than any existing community.': 583, 'This shows an altogether\\nunprecedented boldness in the human mind which had hitherto accepted social traditions and usages with scarcely\\na question.': 432, 'Plato said plainly to mankind Most of the social and political ills from which you suffer are under\\nyour control, given only the will and courage to change

Alexander, the kings son,\\nwho was destined to achieve very great things of which we shall soon be telling.': 846, 'Aristotles work upon methods of\\nthinking carried the science of Logic to a level at which it remained for fifteen hundred years or more, until the\\nmediaeval schoolmen took up the ancient questions again.': 864, 'He made no Utopias.': 185, 'Before man could really control\\nhis destiny as Plato taught, Aristotle perceived that he needed far more knowledge and far more accurate\\nknowledge than he possessed.': 652, 'And so Aristotle began that systematic collection of knowledge which nowadays\\nwe call Science.': 176, 'He sent out explorers to collect facts.': 31, 'He was the father of natural history.': 331, 'He was the founder of\\npolitical science.': 173, 'His

the history of mankind.': 1044, 'It is the true beginning of Modern History.': 76, 'BOTH the work of research and the work of dissemination went on under serious handicaps.': 228, 'One of these was the\\ngreat social gap that separated the philosopher, who was a gentleman, from the trader and the artisan.': 551, 'There were\\nglass workers and metal workers in abundance in those days, but they were not in mental contact with the\\nthinkers.': 161, 'The glass worker was making the most beautifully coloured beads and phials and so forth, but he never\\nmade a Florentine flask or a lens.': 316, 'Clear glass does not seem to have interested him.': 64, 'The metal worker made\\nweapons and jewellery but he never made a chemical balance.': 465, 'The philosopher speculated loftily about atoms and\\nthe nature of things, but he had no practical experience of enamels and pigments and philters and so forth.': 147, 'He was\\nnot interested in substances.': 9, 'So Alexandria in its brief day of opportunity produced no microscopes and no\\nchemistry.': 79, 'And though Hero invented a steam engine it was never set either to pump or drive a boat or do any\\nuseful thing.': 301, 'There were few practical applications of science except in the realm of medicine, and the progress of\\nscience was not stimulated and sustained by the interest and excitement of practical applications.': 236, 'There was\\nnothing to keep the work going therefore when the intellectual curiosity of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II was\\nwithdrawn.': 197, 'The discoveries of the Museum went on record in obscure manuscripts and never, until the revival of\\nscientific curiosity at the Renascence, reached out to the mass of mankind.': 375, 'Nor did the Library produce any improvements in book making.': 52, 'That ancient world had no paper made in definite\\nsizes from rag pulp.': 742, 'Paper was a Chinese invention and it did not reach the western world until the ninth century\\nA.D.': 780, 'The only book materials were parchment and strips of the papyrus reed joined edge to edge.': 50, 'These strips\\nwere kept on rolls which were very unwieldy to wind to and fro and read, and very inconvenient for reference.': 66, 'It\\nwas these things that prevented the development of paged and printed books.': 186, 'Printing itself was known in the\\nworld it would seem as early as the Old Stone Age there were seals in ancient Sumeria but without abundant\\npaper there was little advantage in printing books, an improvement that may further have been resisted by trades\\nunionism on the part of the copyists employed.': 1275, 'Alexandria produced abundant books but not cheap books, and it\\nnever spread knowledge into the population of the ancient world below the level of a wealthy and influential\\nclass.': 899, 'So it was that this blaze of intellectual enterprise never reached beyond a small circle of people in touch with the\\ngroup of philosophers collected by the first two Ptolemies.': 927, 'It was like the light in a dark lantern which is shut off\\nfrom the world at large.': 657, 'Within the blaze may be blindingly bright, but nevertheless it is unseen.': 123, 'The rest of the\\nworld went on its old ways unaware that the seed of scientific knowledge that was one day to revolutionize it\\naltogether had been sown.': 1115, 'Presently a darkness of bigotry fell even upon Alexandria.': 421, 'Thereafter for a thousand\\nyears of darkness the seed that Aristotle had sown lay hidden.': 261, 'Then it stirred and began to germinate.': 82, 'In a few\\ncenturies it had become that widespread growth of knowledge and clear ideas that is now changing the whole of\\nhuman life.': 739, 'Alexandria was not the only centre of Greek intellectual activity in the third century B.C.': 312, 'There were many other\\ncities that displayed a brilliant intellectual life amidst the disintegrating fragments of the brief empire ofA Short History of the World.': 713, 'There was, for example, the Greek city of Syracuse in Sicily, where thought and science flourished for\\ntwo centuries there was Pergamum in Asia Minor, which also had a great library.': 986, 'But this brilliant Hellenic world\\nwas now stricken by invasion from the north.': 589, 'New Nordic barbarians, the Gauls, were striking down along the\\ntracks that had once been followed by the ancestors of

subjugated all the western half of the vast realm of Darius and Alexander.': 858, 'They were an able but\\nunimaginative people, preferring law and profit to either science of art.': 379, 'New invaders were also coming down out\\nof central Asia to shatter and subdue the Seleucid empire and to cut off the western world again from India.': 979, 'These\\nwere the Parthians, hosts of mounted

Mongolian speech.': 385, 'But of these\\nlatter people we shall tell more in a subsequent chapter.': 318, 'The Life of Gautama Buddha\\nBUT now we must go back three centuries in our story to tell of a great teacher who came near to revolutionizing\\nthe religious thought and feeling of all Asia.': 1066, 'This was Gautama Buddha, who taught his disciples at Benares in\\nIndia about the same time that Isaiah was prophesying among the Jews in Babylon and Heraclitus was carrying on\\nhis speculative enquiries into the nature of things at Ephesus.': 409, 'All these men were in the world at the same time, in\\nthe sixth century B.C.unaware of one another.': 1410, 'The sixth century B.C.': 232, 'was indeed one of the most remarkable in all history.': 578, 'Everywherefor as we shall tell it\\nwas also the case in Chinamens minds were displaying a new boldness.': 478, 'Everywhere they were waking up out of\\nthe traditions of kingships and priests and blood sacrifices and asking the most penetrating questions.': 122, 'It is as if the\\nrace had reached a stage of adolescenceafter a childhood of twenty thousand years.': 336, 'The early history of India is still very obscure.': 530, 'Somewhen perhaps about 2000 B.C., an Aryanspeaking people\\ncame down from the northwest into India either in one invasion or in a series of invasions and was able to\\nspread its language and traditions over most of north India.': 961, 'Its peculiar variety of Aryan speech was the Sanskrit.': 45, 'They found a brunette people with a more elaborate civilization and less vigour of will, in possession of the\\ncountry of the Indus and Ganges.': 511, 'But they do not seem to have mingled with their predecessors as freely as did\\nthe Greeks and Persians.': 66, 'They remained aloof.': 57, 'When the past of India becomes dimly visible to the historian,\\nIndian society is already stratified into several layers, with a variable number of subdivisions, which do not eat\\ntogether nor intermarry nor associate freely.': 278, 'And throughout history this stratification into castes continues.': 340, 'This\\nmakes the Indian population something different from the simple, freely interbreeding European or Mongolian\\ncommunities.': 183, 'It is really a community of communities.': 56, 'Siddhattha Gautama was the son of an aristocratic family which ruled a small district on the Himalayan slopes.': 153, 'He\\nwas married at nineteen to a beautiful cousin.': 24, 'He hunted and played and went about in his sunny world of gardens\\nand groves and irrigated ricefields.': 599, 'And it was amidst this life that a great discontent fell upon him.': 1006, 'It was the\\nunhappiness of a fine brain that seeks employment.': 30, 'He felt that the existence he was leading was not the reality of\\nlife, but a holidaya holiday that had gone on too long.': 390, 'The sense of disease and mortality, the insecurity and the unsatisfactoriness of all happiness, descended upon the\\nmind of Gautama.': 391, 'While he was in this mood he met one of those wandering ascetics who already existed in great\\nnumbers in India.': 801, 'These men lived under severe rules, spending

History of the World.': 336, 'The Life of Gautama Buddha 46He was meditating upon this project, says the story, when the news was brought to him that his wife had been\\ndelivered of his firstborn son.': 437, 'This is another tie to break, said Gautama.': 111, 'He returned to the village amidst the rejoicings of his fellow clansmen.': 38, 'There was a great feast and a Nautch\\ndance to celebrate the birth of his new tie, and in the night Gautama awoke in a great agony of spirit, like a man\\nwho is told that his house is on fire.': 1570, 'He resolved to leave his happy aimless life forthwith.': 246, 'He went softly to the\\nthreshold of his wifes chamber, and saw her by the light of a little oil lamp, sleeping sweetly, surrounded by\\nflowers, with his infant son in her arms.': 280, 'He felt a great craving to take up the child in one first and last embrace\\nbefore he departed, but the fear of waking his wife prevented him, and at last he turned away and went out into\\nthe bright Indian moonshine and mounted his horse and rode off into the world.': 1888, 'Very far he rode that night, and in the morning he stopped outside the lands of his clan, and dismounted beside a\\nsandy river.': 203, 'There he cut off his flowing locks with his sword, removed all his ornaments and sent them and his\\nhorse and sword back to his house.': 132, 'Going on he presently met a ragged man and exchanged clothes with him, and\\nso having divested himself of all worldly entanglements he was free to pursue his search after wisdom.': 304, 'He made\\nhis way southward to a resort of hermits and teachers in a hilly spur of the Vindhya Mountains.': 284, 'There lived a\\nnumber of wise men in a warren of caves, going into the town for their simple supplies and imparting their\\nknowledge by word of mouth to such as cared to come to them.': 477, 'Gautama became versed in all the metaphysics of\\nhis age.': 236, 'But his acute intelligence was dissatisfied with the solutions offered him.': 33, 'The Indian mind has always been disposed to believe that power and knowledge may be obtained by extreme\\nasceticism, by fasting, sleeplessness, and selftorment, and these ideas Gautama now put to the test.': 527, 'He betook\\nhimself with five disciple companions to the jungle and there he gave himself up to fasting and terrible penances.': 81, 'His fame spread, like the sound of a great bell hung in the canopy of the skies.': 643, 'But it brought him no sense of\\ntruth achieved.': 79, 'One day he was walking up and down, trying to think in spite of his enfeebled state.': 156, 'Suddenly he\\nfell unconscious.': 39, 'When he recovered, the preposterousness of these semimagical ways to wisdom was plain to\\nhim.': 42, 'He horrified his companions by demanding ordinary food and refusing to continue his mortifications.': 56, 'He had\\nrealized that whatever truth a man may reach is reached best by a nourished brain in a healthy body.': 381, 'Such a\\nconception was absolutely foreign to the ideas of the land and age.': 309, 'His disciples deserted him, and went off in a\\nmelancholy state to Benares.': 184, 'Gautama wandered alone.': 13, 'When the mind grapples with a great and intricate problem, it makes its advances step by step, with but little\\nrealization of the gains it has made, until suddenly, with an effect of abrupt illumination, it realizes its victory.': 893, 'So\\nit happened to Gautama.': 8, 'He had seated himself under a great tree by the side of a river to eat, when this sense of\\nclear version came to him.': 709, 'It seemed to him that he saw life plain.': 290, 'He is said to have sat all day and all night in\\nprofound thought, and then he rose up to impart his vision to the world.': 645, 'He went on to Benares and there he sought out and won back his lost disciples to his new teaching.': 500, 'In the Kings\\nDeer Park at Benares they built themselves huts and set up a sort of school to which came many who were\\nseeking after wisdom.': 437, 'The starting point of his teaching was his own question as a fortunate young man, Why am I not completely\\nhappy It was an introspective question.': 324, 'It was a question very different in quality from the frank and\\nselfforgetful externalized curiosity with which Thales and Heraclitus were attacking the problems of the\\nuniverse, or the equally selfforgetful burthen of moral obligation that the culminating prophets were imposing\\nupon the Hebrew mind.': 532, 'The Indian teacher did not forget self, he concentrated upon self and sought to destroy it.': 334, 'All suffering, he taught, was due to the greedy desires of the individual.': 63, 'Until man has conquered his personal\\ncravings his life is trouble and his end sorrow.': 523, 'There were three principal forms that the craving for life took and\\nthey were all evil.': 346, 'The first was the desire of the appetites, greed and all forms of sensuousness, the second wasA Short History of the World.': 352, 'The Life of Gautama Buddha 47the desire for a personal and egotistic immortality, the third was the craving for personal success, worldliness,\\navarice and the like.': 232, 'All these forms of desire had to be overcome to escape from the distresses and chagrins of\\nlife.': 275, 'When they were overcome, when self had vanished altogether, then serenity of soul, Nirvana, the highest\\ngood was attained.': 117, 'This was the gist of his teaching, a very subtle and metaphysical teaching indeed, not nearly so easy to understand\\nas the Greek injunction to see and know fearlessly and rightly and the Hebrew command to fear God and\\naccomplish righteousness.': 296, 'It was a teaching much beyond the understanding of even Gautamas immediate\\ndisciples, and it is no wonder that so soon as his personal influence was withdrawn it became corrupted and\\ncoarsened.': 536, 'There was a widespread belief in India at that time that at long intervals Wisdom came to earth and\\nwas incarnate in some chosen person who was known as the Buddha.': 561, 'Gautamas disciples declared that he was a\\nBuddha, the latest of the Buddhas, though there is no evidence that he himself ever accepted the title.': 118, 'Before he\\nwas well dead, a cycle of fantastic legends began to be woven about him.': 151, 'The human heart was always preferred a\\nwonder story to a moral effort, and Gautama Buddha became very wonderful.': 384, 'Yet there remained a substantial gain in the world.': 538, 'If Nirvana was too high and subtle for most mens\\nimaginations, if the mythmaking impulse in the race was too strong for the simple facts of Gautamas life, they\\ncould at least grasp something of the intention of what Gautama called the Eightfold way, the Aryan or Noble\\nPath in life.': 872, 'In this there was an insistence upon mental uprightness, upon right aims and speech, right conduct\\nand honest livelihood.': 656, 'There was a quickening of the conscience and an appeal to generous and selfforgetful\\nends.': 33, 'King Asoka\\nFOR some generations after the death of Gautama, these high and noble Buddhist teachings, this first plain\\nteaching that the highest good for man is the subjugation of self, made comparatively little headway in the world.': 1396, 'Then they conquered the imagination of one of the greatest monarchs the world has ever seen.': 852, 'We have already mentioned how Alexander the Great came down into India and fought with Porus upon the\\nIndus.': 547, 'It is related by the Greek historians that a certain Chandragupta Maurya came into Alexanders camp and\\ntried to persuade him to go on to the Ganges and conquer all India.': 262, 'Alexander could not do this because of the\\nrefusal of his Macedonians to go further into what was for them an unknown world, and later on 321 B.C.': 654, 'Chandragupta was able to secure the help of various hill tribes and realize his dream without Greek help.': 231, 'He built\\nup an empire in North India and was presently 303 B.C.': 294, 'able to attack Seleucus I in the Punjab and drive the last\\nvestige of Greek power out of India.': 286, 'His son extended this new empire.': 543, 'His grandson, Asoka, the monarch of\\nwhom we now have to tell, found himself in 264 B.C.': 156, 'ruling from Afghanistan to Madras.': 15, 'Asoka was at first disposed to

his\\nmilitary operations andalone among conquerorshe was so disgusted by the cruelty and horror of war that he\\nrenounced it.': 428, 'He would have no more of it.': 178, 'He adopted the peaceful doctrines of Buddhism and declared that\\nhenceforth his conquests should be the conquests of religion.': 112, 'His reign for eightandtwenty years was one of the brightest interludes in the troubled history of mankind.': 769, 'He\\norganized a great digging of wells in India and the planting of trees for shade.': 475, 'He founded hospitals and public\\ngardens and gardens for the growing of medicinal herbs.': 84, 'He created a ministry for the care of the aborigines and\\nsubject races of India.': 43, 'He made provision for the education of women.': 212, 'He made vast benefactions to the Buddhist\\nteaching orders, and tried to stimulate them to a better and more energetic criticism of their own accumulated\\nliterature.': 372, 'For corruptions and superstitious accretions had

'Such was Asoka, greatest of kings.': 55, 'He was far in advance of his age.': 250, 'He left no prince and no organization of men\\nto carry on his work, and within a century of his death the great days of his reign had become a glorious memory\\nin a shattered and decaying India.': 1207, 'The priestly caste of the Brahmins, the highest and most privileged caste in the\\nIndian social body, has always been opposed to the frank and open teaching of Buddha.': 226, 'Gradually they\\nundermined the Buddhist influence in the land.': 101, 'The old monstrous gods, the innumerable cults of

Brahminism in a multitude of forms replaced it.': 339, 'But beyond the confines of India and the realms of caste Buddhism spreaduntil it had won China and Siam and\\nBurma and Japan, countries in which it is predominant to this day.': 104, 'Confucius and Lao Tse\\nWE have still to tell of two other great men, Confucius and Lao Tse, who lived in that wonderful century which\\nbegan the adolescence of mankind, the sixth century B.C.': 1572, 'In this history thus far we have told very little of the\\nearly story of China.': 642, 'At present that early history is still very obscure, and we look to Chinese explorers and\\narchaeologists in the new China that is now arising to work out their past as thoroughly as the European past has\\nbeen worked out during the last century.': 1293, 'Very long ago the first primitive Chinese civilizations arose in the great\\nriver valleys out of the primordial heliolithic culture.': 1007, 'They had, like Egypt and Sumeria, the general\\ncharacteristics of that culture, and they centred upon temples in which priests and priest kings offered the seasonal\\nblood sacrifices.': 682, 'The life in those cities must have been very like the Egyptian and Sumerian life of six or seven\\nthousand years ago and very like the Maya life of Central America a thousand years ago.': 1552, 'If there were human sacrifices they had long given way to animal sacrifices before the dawn of history.': 671, 'And a\\nform of picture writing was growing up long before a thousand years B.C.': 398, 'And just as the primitive civilizations of Europe and western Asia were in conflict with the nomads of the desert\\nand the nomads of the north, so the primitive Chinese civilizations had a great cloud of nomadic peoples on their\\nnorthern borders.': 1023, 'There was a number of tribes akin in language and ways of living, who are spoken of in history\\nin succession as the Huns, the Mongols, the Turks and Tartars.': 497, 'They changed and divided and combined and\\nrecombined, just as the Nordic peoples in north Europe and central Asia changed and varied in name rather than\\nin nature.': 400, 'These Mongolian nomads had horses earlier than the Nordic peoples, and it may be that in the region of\\nthe Altai Mountains they made an independent discovery of iron somewhen after 1000 B.C.': 541, 'And just as in the\\nwestern case so ever and again these eastern nomads would achieve a sort of political unity, and become the\\nconquerors and masters and revivers of this or that settled and civilized region.': 665, 'It is quite possible that the earliest civilization of China was not Mongolian at all any more than the earliest\\ncivilization of Europe and western Asia was Nordic or Semitic.': 321, 'It is quite possible that the earliest civilization of\\nChina was a brunette civilization and of a piece with the earliest Egyptian, Sumerian and Dravidian civilizations,\\nand that when the first recorded history of China began there had already been conquests and intermixture.': 1044, 'At any\\nrate we find that by 1750 B.C.': 54, 'China was already a vast system of little kingdoms and city states, all\\nacknowledging a loose allegiance and paying more or less regularly, more or less definite feudal dues to one great\\npriest emperor, the Son of Heaven.': 1357, 'The Shang dynasty came to an end in 1125 B.C.': 256, 'A Chow dynasty\\nsucceeded Shang, and maintained China in a relaxing unity until the days of Asoka in India and of the Ptolemies\\nin Egypt.': 148, 'Gradually China went to pieces during that long Chow period.': 249, 'Hunnish peoples came down and set up\\nprincipalities local rulers discontinued their tribute and became independent.': 508, 'There was in the sixth century B.C.,\\nsays one Chinese authority, five or six thousand practically independent states in China.': 717, 'It was what the Chinese\\ncall in their records an Age of Confusion.A Short History of the World.': 30, 'Confucius and Lao Tse 49But this Age of Confusion was compatible with much intellectual activity and with the existence of many local\\ncentres of art and civilized living.': 431, 'When we know more of Chinese history we shall find that China also had her\\nMiletus and her Athens, her Pergamum and her Macedonia.': 486, 'At present we must be vague and brief about this\\nperiod of Chinese division simply because our knowledge is not sufficient for us to frame a coherent and\\nconsecutive story.': 356, 'And just as in divided Greece there were philosophers and in shattered and captive Jewry prophets, so in\\ndisordered China there were philosophers and teachers at this time.': 292, 'In all these cases insecurity and uncertainty\\nseemed to have quickened the better sort of mind.': 202, 'Confucius was a man of aristocratic origin and some official\\nimportance in a small state called Lu.': 412, 'Here in a very parallel mood to the Greek impulse he set up a sort of\\nAcademy for discovering and teaching Wisdom.': 211, 'The lawlessness and disorder of China distressed him\\nprofoundly.': 22, 'He conceived an ideal of a better government and a better life, and travelled from state to state\\nseeking a prince who would carry out his legislative and educational ideas.': 798, 'He never found his prince he found a\\nprince, but court intrigues undermined the influence of the teacher and finally defeated his reforming proposals.': 411, 'It\\nis interesting to note that a century and a half later the Greek philosopher Plato also sought a prince, and was for a\\ntime adviser to the tyrant Dionysius who ruled Syracuse in Sicily.': 732, 'Confucius died a disappointed man.': 201, 'No intelligent ruler arises to take me as his master, he said, and my time\\nhas come to die.': 356, 'But his teaching had more vitality than he imagined in his declining and hopeless years, and it\\nbecame a great formative influence with the Chinese people.': 1032, 'It became one of what the Chinese call the Three\\nTeachings, the other two being those of Buddha and of Lao Tse.': 486, 'The gist of the teaching of Confucius was the way of the noble or aristocratic man.': 310, 'He was concerned with\\npersonal conduct as much as Gautama was concerned with the peace of selfforgetfulness and the Greek with\\nexternal knowledge and the Jew with righteousness.': 315, 'He was the most publicminded of all great teachers.': 454, 'He was\\nsupremely concerned by the confusion and miseries of the world, and he wanted to make men noble in order to\\nbring about a noble world.': 1320, 'He sought to regulate conduct to an extraordinary extent to provide sound rules for\\nevery occasion in life.': 357, 'A polite, publicspirited gentleman, rather sternly selfdisciplined, was the ideal he found\\nalready developing in the northern Chinese world and one to which he gave a permanent form.': 1041, 'The teaching of Lao Tse, who was for a long time in charge of the imperial library of the Chow dynasty, was\\nmuch more mystical and vague and elusive than that of Confucius.': 565, 'He seems to have preached a stoical\\nindifference to the pleasures and powers of the world and a return to an imaginary simple life of the past.': 844, 'He left\\nwritings very contracted in style and very obscure.': 62, 'He wrote in riddles.': 15, 'After his death his teachings, like the\\nteachings of Gautama Buddha, were corrupted and overlaid by legends and had the most complex and\\nextraordinary observances and superstitious ideas grafted upon them.': 589, 'In China just as in India primordial ideas of\\nmagic and monstrous legends out of the childish past of our race struggled against the new thinking in the world\\nand succeeded in plastering it over with grotesque, irrational and antiquated observances.': 963, 'Both Buddhism and\\nTaoism which ascribes itself largely to Lao Tse as one finds them in China now, are religions of monk, temple,\\npriest and offering of a type as ancient in form, if not in thought, as the sacrificial religions of ancient Sumeria and\\nEgypt.': 603, 'But the teaching of Confucius was not so overlaid because it was limited and plain and straightforward and\\nlent itself to no such distortions.': 82, 'North China, the China of the Hwangho River, became Confucian in thought and spirit south China,\\nYangtseKiang China, became Taoist.': 379, 'Since those days a conflict has always been traceable in Chinese affairs\\nbetween these two spirits, the spirit of the north and the spirit of the south, between in latter times Pekin and\\nNankin, between the officialminded, upright and conservative north, and the sceptical, artistic, lax and\\nexperimental south.': 764, 'The divisions of China of the Age of Confusion reached their worst stage in the sixth century B.C.': 303, 'The Chow\\ndynasty was so enfeebled and so discredited that Lao Tse left the unhappy court and retired into private life.A Short History of the World.': 147, 'Confucius and Lao Tse 50Three nominally subordinate powers dominated the situation in those days, Tsi and Tsin, both northern powers,\\nand Chu, which was an aggressive military power in the Yangtse valley.': 399, 'At last Tsi and Tsin formed an alliance,\\nsubdued Chu and imposed a general treaty of disarmament and peace in China.': 241, 'The power of Tsin became\\npredominant.': 244, 'Finally about the time of Asoka in India the Tsin monarch seized upon the sacrificial vessels of the\\nChow emperor and took over his sacrificial duties.': 681, 'His son, ShiHwangti king in 246 B.C., emperor in 220\\nB.C., is called in the Chinese Chronicles the First Universal Emperor.': 259, 'More fortunate than Alexander, ShiHwangti reigned for thirtysix years as king and emperor.': 351, 'His energetic\\nreign marks the beginning of a new era of unity and prosperity for the Chinese people.': 601, 'He fought vigorously\\nagainst the Hunnish invaders from the northern deserts, and he began that immense work, the Great Wall of\\nChina, to set a limit to their incursions.': 303, 'Rome Comes into History\\nTHE READER will note a general similarity in the history of all these civilizations in spite of the effectual\\nseparation caused by the great barriers of the Indian northwest frontier and of the mountain masses of Central\\nAsia and further India.': 934, 'First for thousands of years the heliolithic culture spread over all the warm and fertile river\\nvalleys of the old world and developed a temple system and priest rulers about its sacrificial traditions.': 1046, 'Apparently its first makers were always those brunette peoples we have spoken of as the central race of mankind.': 546, 'Then the nomads came in from the regions of seasonal grass and seasonal migrations and superposed their own\\ncharacteristics and often their own language on the primitive civilization.': 389, 'They subjugated and stimulated it, and\\nwere stimulated to fresh developments

'For some centuries the internal history of Rome was the story of a long and obstinate struggle for freedom and a\\nshare in the government on the part of the plebeians.': 716, 'It would not be difficult to find Greek parallels to this\\nconflict, which the Greeks would have called a conflict of aristocracy with democracy.': 528, 'In the end the plebeians\\nbroke down most of the exclusive

the\\npossession of all Sicily except the dominions of the Greek king of Syracuse.': 216, 'The advantage of the sea was at first\\nwith the Carthaginians.': 354, 'They had great fighting ships of what was hitherto an unheardof size, quinqueremes,\\ngalleys with five banks of oars and a huge ram.': 598, 'At the battle of Salamis, two centuries before, the leading\\nbattleships had only been triremes with three banks.': 302, 'But the Romans, with extraordinary energy and in spite of the\\nfact that they had little naval experience, set themselves to outbuild the Carthaginians.': 267, 'They manned the new navy\\nthey created chiefly with Greek seamen, and they invented grappling and boarding to make up for the superior\\nseamanship of the enemy.': 375, 'When the Carthaginian came up to ram or

'Spain at that time was Carthaginian as far north as the river Ebro.': 426, 'To that boundary the Romans restricted them.A Short History of the World.': 7, 'Rome and Carthage 53Any crossing of the Ebro by the Carthaginians was to be considered an act of war against the Romans.': 161, 'At last in\\n218 B.C.': 98, 'the Carthaginians, provoked by new Roman aggressions, did cross this river under a young general\\nnamed Hannibal, one of the most brilliant commanders in the whole of history.': 995, 'He marched his army from Spain\\nover the Alps into Italy, raised the Gauls against the Romans,

escaped and\\nfled to Asia where later, being in danger of falling into the hands of his relentless enemies, he took poison and\\ndied.': 192, 'For fiftysix years Rome and the shorn city of Carthage were at peace.': 302, 'And meanwhile Rome spread her empire\\nover confused and divided Greece, invaded Asia Minor, and defeated Antiochus III, the Seleucid monarch, at\\nMagnesia in Lydia.': 394, 'She made Egypt, still under the Ptolemies, and Pergamum and most of the small states of Asia\\nMinor into Allies, or, as we should call them now, protected states.': 630, 'Meanwhile Carthage, subjugated and enfeebled, had been slowly regaining something of her former prosperity.': 94, 'Her recovery revived the hate and suspicion of the Romans.': 15, 'She was attacked upon the most shallow and artificial\\nof quarrels 149 B.C., she made an obstinate and bitter resistance, stood a long siege and was stormed 146 B.C..': 623, 'The street fighting, or massacre, lasted six days it was extraordinarily bloody, and when the citadel capitulated\\nonly about fifty thousand of the Carthaginian population remained alive out of a quarter of a million.': 337, 'They were\\nsold into slavery, and the city was burnt and elaborately destroyed.': 151, 'The blackened ruins were ploughed and sown\\nas a sort of ceremonial effacement.': 84, 'So ended the Third Punic War.': 11, 'Of all the Semitic states and cities that had flourished in the world five centuries\\nbefore only one little country remained free under native rulers.': 1293, 'This was Judea, which had liberated itself from\\nthe Seleucids and was under the rule of the native Maccabean princes.': 101, 'By this time it had its Bible almost\\ncomplete, and was developing the distinctive traditions of the Jewish world as we know it now.': 801, 'It was natural that\\nthe Carthaginians, Phoenicians and kindred peoples dispersed about the world should find a common link in their\\npractically identical language and in this literature of hope and courage.': 848, 'To a large extent they were still the\\ntraders and bankers of the world.': 681, 'The Semitic world had been submerged rather than replaced.': 535, 'Jerusalem, which has always been rather the symbol than the centre of Judaism, was taken by the Romans in 65\\nB.C.': 108, 'and after various vicissitudes of quasiindependence and revolt was besieged by them in 70 A.D. and\\ncaptured after a stubborn struggle.': 111, 'The Temple was destroyed.': 36, 'A later rebellion in 132 A.D. completed its\\ndestruction, and the Jerusalem we know today was rebuilt later under Roman auspices.': 209, 'A temple to the Roman\\ngod, Jupiter Capitolinus, stood in the place of the Temple, and Jews were forbidden to inhabit the city.': 239, 'The Growth of the Roman Empire\\nNOW this new Roman power which arose to dominate the western world in the second and first centuries B.C.': 1356, 'was in several respects a different thing from any of the great empires that had hitherto prevailed in the civilized\\nworld.': 1147, 'It was not at first a monarchy, and it was not the creation of any one great conqueror.': 995, 'It was not indeed the\\nfirst of republican empires Athens had dominated a group of Allies and dependents in the time of Pericles, and\\nCarthage when she entered upon her fatal struggle with Rome was mistress of Sardinia and Corsica, Morocco,\\nAlgiers, Tunis, and most of Spain and Sicily.': 941, 'But it was the first republican empire that escaped extinction andA Short History of the World.': 516, 'The Growth of the Roman Empire 54went on to fresh developments.': 36, 'The centre of this new system lay far to the west of the more ancient centres of empire, which had hitherto been\\nthe river valleys of Mesopotamia and Egypt.': 849, 'This westward position enabled Rome to bring in to civilization\\nquite fresh regions and peoples.': 302, 'The Roman power extended to Morocco and Spain, and was presently able to\\nthrust northwestward over what is now France and Belgium to Britain and northeastward into Hungary and\\nSouth Russia.': 249, 'But on the other hand it was never able to maintain itself in Central Asia or Persia because they\\nwere too far from its administrative centres.': 247, 'It included therefore great masses of fresh Nordic Aryanspeaking\\npeoples, it presently incorporated nearly all the Greek people in the world, and its population was less strongly\\nHamitic and Semitic than that of any preceding empire.': 1721, 'For some centuries this Roman Empire did not fall into the grooves of precedent that had so speedily swallowed\\nup Persian and Greek, and all that time it developed.': 350, 'The rulers of the Medes and Persians became entirely\\nBabylonized in a generation or so they took over the tiara of the king of kings and the temples and priesthoods of\\nhis gods Alexander and his successors followed in the same easy path of assimilation the Seleucid monarchs had\\nmuch the same court and administrative methods as Nebuchadnezzar the Ptolemies became Pharaohs and\\naltogether Egyptian.': 823, 'They were assimilated just as before them the Semitic conquerors of the Sumerians had been\\nassimilated.': 38, 'But the Romans ruled in their own city, and for some centuries kept to the laws of their own nature.': 244, 'The only people who exercised any great mental influence upon them before the second or third century A.D.\\nwere the kindred and similar Greeks.': 1333, 'So that the Roman Empire was essentially a first attempt to rule a great\\ndominion upon mainly Aryan lines.': 1097, 'It was so far a new pattern in history, it was an expanded Aryan republic.': 714, 'The\\nold pattern of a personal conqueror ruling over a capital city that had grown up round the temple of a harvest god\\ndid not apply to it.': 399, 'The Romans had gods and temples, but like the gods of the Greeks their gods were\\nquasihuman immortals, divine patricians.': 277, 'The Romans also had blood sacrifices and even made human ones in\\ntimes of stress, things they may have learnt to do from their dusky Etruscan teachers but until Rome was long\\npast its zenith neither priest nor temple played a large part in Roman history.': 1412, 'The Roman Empire was a growth, an unplanned novel growth the Roman people found themselves engaged\\nalmost unawares in a vast administrative experiment.': 479, 'It cannot be called a successful experiment.': 78, 'In the end their\\nempire collapsed altogether.': 341, 'And it changed enormously in form and method from century to century.': 491, 'It changed\\nmore in a hundred years than Bengal or Mesopotamia or Egypt changed in a thousand.': 291, 'It was always changing.': 28, 'It\\nnever attained to any fixity.': 76, 'In a sense the experiment failed.': 46, 'In a sense the experiment remains unfinished, and Europe and America today\\nare still working out the riddles of worldwide statescraft first confronted by the Roman people.': 801, 'It is well for the student of history to bear in mind the very great changes not only in political but in social and\\nmoral matters that went on throughout the period of Roman dominion.': 1308, 'There is much too strong a tendency in\\npeoples minds to think of the Roman rule as something finished and stable, firm, rounded, noble and decisive.': 407, 'the elder Cato, the Scipios, Julius Caesar, Diocletian, Constantine\\nthe Great, triumphs, orations, gladiatorial combats and Christian martyrs are all mixed up together in a picture of\\nsomething high and cruel and dignified.': 146, 'The items of that picture have to be disentangled.': 12, 'They are collected at\\ndifferent points from a process of change profounder than that which separates the London of William the\\nConqueror from the London of today.': 173, 'We may very conveniently divide the expansion of Rome into four stages.': 154, 'The first stage began after the sack of\\nRome by the Goths in 390 B.C.': 373, 'and went on until the end of the First Punic War 240 B.C.. We may call this\\nstage the stage of the Assimilative Republic.': 334, 'It was perhaps the finest, most characteristic stage in Roman history.': 353, 'The agelong dissensions of patrician and plebeian were drawing to a close, the Etruscan threat had come to an\\nend, no one was very rich yet nor very poor, and most men were publicspirited.': 685, 'It was a republic like the\\nrepublic of the South African Boers before 1900 or like the northern states of the American Union between 1800A Short History of the World.': 474, 'The Growth of the Roman Empire 55and 1850 a freefarmers republic.': 51, 'At the outset of this stage Rome was a little state scarcely twenty miles square.': 263, 'She fought the sturdy but kindred states about her, and sought not their destruction but coalescence.': 191, 'Her centuries\\nof civil dissension had trained her people in compromise and concessions.': 343, 'Some of the defeated cities became\\naltogether Roman with a voting share in the government, some became selfgoverning with the right to trade and\\nmarry in Rome garrisons full of citizens were set up at strategic points and colonies of varied privileges founded\\namong the freshly conquered people.': 1001, 'Great roads were made.': 194, 'The rapid Latinization of all Italy was the inevitable\\nconsequence of such a policy.': 34, 'In 89 B.C.': 1, 'all the free inhabitants of Italy became citizens of the city of Rome\\nFormally the whole Roman Empire became at last an extended city.': 609, 'In 212 A.D. every free man in the entire\\nextent of the empire was given citizenship the right, if he could get there, to vote in the town meeting in Rome.': 679, 'This extension of citizenship to tractable cities and to whole countries was the distinctive device of Roman\\nexpansion.': 212, 'It reversed the old process of conquest and assimilation altogether.': 190, 'By the Roman method the\\nconquerors assimilated the conquered.': 86, 'But after the First Punic War and the annexation of Sicily, though the old process of assimilation still went on,\\nanother process arose by its side.': 546, 'Sicily for instance was treated as a conquered prey.': 59, 'It was declared an estate\\nof the Roman people.': 252, 'Its rich soil and industrious population was exploited to make Rome rich.': 167, 'The patricians\\nand the more influential among the plebeians secured the major share of that wealth.': 117, 'And the war also brought in\\na large supply of slaves.': 361, 'Before the First Punic War the population of the republic had been largely a population\\nof citizen farmers.': 198, 'Military service was their privilege and liability.': 20, 'While they were on active service their farms\\nfell into debt and a new largescale slave agriculture grew up when they returned they found their produce in\\ncompetition with slavegrown produce from Sicily and from the new estates at home.': 833, 'Times had changed.': 19, 'The\\nrepublic had altered its character.': 61, 'Not only was Sicily in the hands of Rome, the common man was in the hands of\\nthe rich creditor and the rich competitor.': 353, 'Rome had entered upon its second stage, the Republic of Adventurous\\nRich Men.': 364, 'For two hundred years the Roman soldier farmers had struggled for freedom and a share in the government of\\ntheir state for a hundred years they had enjoyed their privileges.': 713, 'The First Punic War wasted them and robbed\\nthem of all they had won.': 13, 'The value of their electoral privileges had also evaporated.': 121, 'The governing bodies of the Roman republic were two\\nin number.': 223, 'The first and more important was the Senate.': 287, 'This was a body originally of patricians and then of\\nprominent men of all sorts, who were summoned to it first by certain powerful officials, the consuls and censors.': 580, 'Like the British House of Lords it became a gathering of great landowners, prominent politicians, big business\\nmen and the like.': 939, 'It was much more like the British House of Lords than it was like the American Senate.': 388, 'For\\nthree centuries, from the Punic Wars onward, it was the centre of Roman political thought and purpose.': 336, 'The\\nsecond body was the Popular Assembly.': 63, 'This was supposed to be an assembly of all the citizens of Rome.': 42, 'When\\nRome was a little state twenty miles square this was a possible gathering.': 272, 'When the citizenship of Rome had\\nspread beyond the confines in Italy, it was an altogether impossible one.': 399, 'Its meetings, proclaimed by\\nhornblowing from the Capitol and the city walls, became more and more a gathering of political hacks and city\\nriffraff.': 409, 'In the fourth century B.C.': 227, 'the Popular Assembly was a considerable check upon the Senate, a competent\\nrepresentation of the claims and rights of the common man.': 573, 'By the end of the Punic Wars it was an impotent relic\\nof a vanquished popular control.': 117, 'No effectual legal check remained upon the big men.': 571, 'Nothing of the nature of representative government was ever introduced into the Roman republic.': 160, 'No one thought\\nof electing delegates to represent the will of the citizens.': 308, 'This is a very important point for the student to grasp.': 52, 'The Popular Assembly never became the equivalent of the American House of Representatives or the British\\nHouse of Commons.': 178, 'In theory it was all the citizens in practice it ceased to be anything at all worth\\nconsideration.A Short History of the World.': 54, 'The Growth of the Roman Empire 56The common citizen of the Roman Empire was therefore in a very poor case after the Second Punic War he was\\nimpoverished, he had often lost his

any form of political expression are the strike and the revolt.': 535, 'The story of the second and first centuries\\nB.C., so far as internal politics go, is a story of futile revolutionary upheaval.': 663, 'The scale of this history will not\\npermit us to tell of the intricate struggles of that time, of the attempts to break up estates and restore the land to\\nthe free farmer, of proposals to abolish debts in whole or in part.': 907, 'There was revolt and civil war.': 155, 'In 73 B.C., the\\ndistresses of Italy were enhanced by a great insurrection of the slaves under

'But the big rich\\nmen who were overcoming him were even in his defeat preparing a new power in the Roman world over\\nthemselves and him, the power of the army.': 1399, 'Before the Second Punic War the army of Rome was a levy of free farmers, who, according to their quality, rode\\nor marched afoot to battle.': 163, 'This was a very good force for wars close at hand, but not the sort of army that will go\\nabroad and bear long campaigns with patience.': 379, 'And moreover as the slaves multiplied and the estates grew, the\\nsupply of freespirited fighting farmers declined.': 152, 'It was

proportion they made of the general population.': 689, 'It probably varied widely in\\ndifferent places and at different periods.': 202, 'And there were also many modifications of slavery, from the slavery that\\nwas chained at night and driven with whips to the farm or quarry, to the slave whose master found it advantageous\\nto leave him to cultivate his patch or work his craft and own his

'And slaveowners began to\\nrealize that the profit and comfort they got from their slaves increased with the selfrespect of these unfortunates.': 178, 'But also the moral tone of the community was rising, and a sense of justice was becoming effective.': 204, 'The higher\\nmentality of Greece was qualifying the old Roman harshness.': 92, 'Restrictions upon cruelty were made, a master\\nmight no longer sell his slave to fight beasts, a slave was given property rights in what was called his peculium,\\nslaves were paid wages as an encouragement and stimulus, a form of slave marriage was

slave presently became a serf, paying his owner part of his produce or\\nworking for him at certain seasons.': 405, 'When we begin to realize how essentially this great Latin and Greekspeaking Roman

rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.': 283, 'Moreover, in his tremendous prophecy of this kingdom which was to make all men one together in God, Jesus had\\nsmall patience for the bargaining

the oldest empires in the world were religious empires, centring upon the worship of a god or of a\\ngodking.': 1021, 'Alexander was treated as a divinity and the Caesars were gods in so much as they had altars and\\ntemples devoted to them and the offering of incense was made a test of loyalty to the Roman state.': 501, 'But these older\\nreligions were essentially religions of act and fact.':

permitting at first a considerable play of violence and private warfare but\\nmaking steadily for order and a new reign of law.': 928, 'The pyramids grew up until some became recognizable as\\nkingdoms.': 161, 'Already by the early sixth century a Frankish kingdom existed under its founder Clovis in what is now\\nFrance and the Netherlands, and presently Visigothic and Lombard and

353, 'He conquered North Italy and made himself master of Rome.': 241, 'Approaching the story of Europe as we do from the wider horizons of a world history we can see much more\\ndistinctly than the mere nationalist historian how cramping and disastrous this tradition of the Latin Roman\\nEmpire was.': 1040, 'A narrow intense struggle for this phantom predominance was to consume European energy for more\\nthan a thousand years.': 302, 'Through all that period it is possible to trace certain unquenchable antagonisms they run\\nthrough the wits of Europe like the obsessions of a demented mind.': 369, 'One driving force was this ambition of\\nsuccessful rulers, which Charlemagne Charles the Great embodied, to become Caesar.': 114, 'The realm of\\nCharlemagne consisted of a complex of feudal German states at various stages of barbarism.': 177, 'West of the Rhine,\\nmost of these German peoples had learnt to speak various Latinized dialects which fused at last to form French.': 304, 'East of the Rhine, the racially similar German peoples did not lose their German speech.': 158, 'On account of this,\\ncommunication was difficult between these two groups of barbarian conquerors and a split easily brought about.': 238, 'The split was made the more easy by the fact that the Frankish usage made it seem natural to divide the empire of\\nCharlemagne among his sons at his death.': 824, 'So one aspect of the history of Europe from the days of Charlemagne\\nonwards is a history of first this monarch and his family and then that, struggling to a precarious headship of the\\nkings, princes, dukes, bishops and cities of Europe, while a steadily deepening antagonism between the French\\nand German speaking elements develops in the medley.': 1417, 'There was a formality of election for each emperor and\\nthe climax of his ambition was to struggle to the possession of that wornout, misplaced capital Rome and to a\\ncoronation there.': 195, 'The next factor in the European political disorder was the resolve of the Church at Rome to make no temporal\\nprince but the Pope of Rome himself emperor in effect.': 329, 'He was already pontifex maximus for all

antagonisms of prince against prince and of Emperor against Pope do not by any means exhaust the\\nfactors of the European confusion.': 76, 'There was still an Emperor in Constantinople speaking Greek and claiming the\\nallegiance of all Europe.': 181, 'When Charlemagne sought to revive the empire, it was merely the Latin end of the\\nempire he revived.': 565, 'It was natural that a sense of rivalry between Latin Empire and Greek Empire should develop\\nvery readily.': 66, 'And still more readily did the rivalry of Greekspeaking Christianity and the newer Latinspeaking\\nversion develop.': 188, 'The Pope of Rome claimed to be the successor of St. Peter, the chief of the apostles of Christ,\\nand the head of the Christian community everywhere.': 140, 'Neither the emperor nor the patriarch in Constantinople\\nwere disposed to acknowledge this claim.': 106, 'A dispute about a fine point in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity\\nconsummated a long series of dissensions in a final rupture in 1054.': 182, 'The Latin Church and the Greek Church\\nbecame and remained thereafter distinct and frankly antagonistic.': 178, 'This antagonism must be added to the others in\\nour estimate of the conflicts that wasted Latin Christendom in the middle ages.': 152, 'Upon this divided world of Christendom rained the blows of three sets of antagonists.': 548, 'About the Baltic and North\\nSeas remained a series of Nordic tribes who were only very slowly and reluctantly Christianized these were the\\nNorthmen.': 149, 'They had taken to the sea and piracy, and were raiding all

after his death they established themselves in what is now\\nHungary and after the fashion of their kindred predecessors, the Huns, raided every summer into the settled parts\\nof Europe.': 450, 'In

Black Sea and the Northmen of the west.': 683, 'Hemmed in by these more vigorous and aggressive peoples, amidst forces they did not understand and dangers\\nthey could not estimate, Charlemagne and after him a series of other ambitious spirits took up the futile drama of\\nrestoring the Western Empire under the name of the Holy Roman Empire.': 381, 'From the time of Charlemagne onward\\nthis idea obsessed the political life of Western Europe, while in the East the Greek half of the Roman power\\ndecayed and dwindled until at last nothing remained of it at all but the corrupt trading city of Constantinople and a\\nfew miles of territory about it.': 1123, 'Politically the continent of Europe remained traditional and uncreative from the\\ntime of Charlemagne onward for a thousand years.': 517, 'The name of Charlemagne looms large in European history but his personality is but indistinctly seen.': 368, 'He could\\nnot read nor write, but he had a considerable respect for learning he liked to be read aloud to at meals and he had\\na weakness for theological discussion.': 229, 'At his winter quarters at AixlaChapelle or Mayence he gathered about\\nhim a number of learned men and picked up much from their conversation.': 414, 'In the summer he made war, against\\nthe Spanish Saracens, against the Slavs and Magyars, against the Saxons, and other still heathen German tribes.': 539, 'It\\nis doubtful whether the idea of becoming Caesar in succession to Romulus Augustulus occurred to him before his\\nacquisition of North Italy, or whether it was suggested to him by Pope Leo III, who was anxious to make the Latin\\nChurch independent of Constantinople.': 203, 'There were the most extraordinary manoeuvres at Rome between the Pope and the prospective emperor in order\\nto make it appear or not appear as if the Pope gave him the imperial crown.': 326, 'The Pope succeeded in crowning his\\nvisitor and conqueror by surprise in St. Peters on Christmas Day 800 A.D.': 33, 'He produced a crown, put it on the\\nhead of Charlemagne and hailed him Caesar and Augustus.': 101, 'There was great applause among the people.': 749, 'Charlemagne was by no means pleased

regularize the election.': 612, 'He confined the votes to the\\nRoman cardinals and he reduced the Emperors share to a formula of assent conceded to him by the church, but he\\nmade no provision for a successordesignate and he left it possible for the disputes of the cardinals to keep the\\nSee vacant, as in some cases it was kept vacant, for a year or more.': 487, 'The consequences of this want of firm definition are to be seen in the whole history of the papacy up to the\\nsixteenth century.': 613, 'From quite early times onward there were disputed elections and two or more men each\\nclaiming to be Pope.': 485, 'The church would then be subjected to the indignity of going to the Emperor or some other\\noutside arbiter to settle the dispute.': 312, 'And the career of every one of the great

only to discredit and undo his work.': 215, 'Or some enfeebled old man tottering on\\nthe brink of the grave might succeed him.': 294, 'It was inevitable that this peculiar weakness of the papal organization should attract the interference of the various\\nGerman princes, the French King, and the Norman and French Kings who ruled in England that they should all\\ntry to influence the elections, and have a Pope in their own interest established in the Lateran Palace at Rome.': 241, 'And the more powerful and important the Pope became in European affairs, the more urgent did these\\ninterventions become.': 221, 'Under the circumstances it is no great wonder that many of the Popes were weak and futile.': 574, 'The astonishing thing is that many of them were able and

Frederick being\\nfar more of a heretic than any of the simple pietists who had incurred the Popes animosity, lacked the crusading\\nimpulse.': 136, 'And when Innocent urged him to crusade against the

met and\\ndiscussed affairs with the Sultan.': 143, 'These two gentlemen, both of sceptical opinions, exchanged congenial views,\\nmade a commercial convention to their mutual advantage, and agreed to

controversy was revived after\\nGregory IX was dead, when Innocent IV was Pope and again a devastating letter, which men were bound to\\nremember, was written by Frederick against the church.': 339, 'He denounced the pride and irreligion of the clergy, and\\nascribed all the corruptions of the time to their pride and wealth.': 261, 'He proposed to his fellow princes a general\\nconfiscation of

great efforts to stay the\\nadvancing tide.': 688, 'It is only recently, says Bury in his notes to Gibbons Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, that European\\nhistory has begun to understand that the successes of the Mongol army which overran Poland and occupied\\nHungary in the spring of A.D. 1241 were won by consummate strategy and were not due to a mere overwhelming\\nsuperiority of numbers.': 434, 'But this fact has not yet become a matter of common knowledge the vulgar opinion\\nwhich represents the Tartars as a wild horde carrying all before them solely by their multitude, and

compared to Subutai.': 59, 'It should also be noticed that the Mongols\\nembarked upon the enterprise with full knowledge of the political situation of Hungary and the condition of\\nPolandthey had taken care to inform themselves by a wellorganized system of spies on the other hand, the\\nHungarians and the Christian powers, like childish barbarians, knew hardly anything about their enemies.': 938, 'But though the Mongols were victorious at Liegnitz, they did not continue their drive westward.': 82, 'They were\\ngetting into woodlands and hilly country, which did not suit their tactics and so they turned southward and\\nprepared to settle in Hungary, massacring or assimilating the kindred Magyar, even as these had previously\\nmassacred and assimilated the mixed Scythians and Avars and Huns before them.': 260, 'From the Hungarian plain they\\nwould probably have made raids west and south as the Hungarians had done in the ninth century, the Avars in the\\nseventh and eighth and the Huns in the fifth.': 839, 'But Ogdai died suddenly, and in 1242 there was trouble about the\\nsuccession, and recalled by this, the undefeated hosts of Mongols began to pour back across Hungary and\\nRoumania towards the east.': 349, 'Thereafter the Mongols concentrated their attention upon their Asiatic conquests.': 326, 'By the middle of the thirteenth\\ncentury they had conquered the Sung Empire.': 288, 'Mangu Khan succeeded Ogdai Khan as Great Khan in 1251, and\\nmade his brother Kublai Khan governor of China.': 207, 'In 1280 Kublai Khan had been formally recognized Emperor of\\nChina, and so founded the Yuan dynasty which lasted until 1368.': 72, 'While the last ruins of the Sung rule were going\\ndown in China, another brother of Mangu, Hulagu, was conquering Persia and Syria.': 247, 'The Mongols displayed a\\nbitter animosity to Islam at this time, and not only massacred the population of Bagdad when they captured that\\ncity, but set to work to destroy the immemorial irrigation system which had kept Mesopotamia incessantly\\nprosperous and populous from the early days of Sumeria.': 752, 'From that time until our own Mesopotamia has been a\\ndesert of ruins, sustaining only a scanty population.': 281, 'Into Egypt the Mongols never penetrated the Sultan of Egypt\\ncompletely defeated an army of Hulagus in Palestine in 1260.': 167, 'After that disaster the tide of Mongol victory ebbed.': 27, 'The dominions of the Great Khan fell into a number of\\nseparate states.': 205, 'The eastern Mongols became Buddhists, like the Chinese the western became Moslim.': 427, 'The\\nChinese threw off the rule of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, and set up the native Ming dynasty which flourished from\\n1368 to 1644.': 227, 'The Russians remained tributary to the Tartar hordes upon the southeast steppes until 1480, when\\nthe Grand Duke of Moscow repudiated his allegiance and laid the foundation of modern Russia.': 440, 'In the fourteenth century there was a brief revival of Mongol vigour under Timurlane, a descendant of Jengis\\nKhan.': 256, 'He established himself in Western Turkestan, assumed the title of Grand Khan in 1369, and conquered\\nfrom Syria to Delhi.': 77, 'He was the most savage and destructive of all the Mongol conquerors.': 42, 'He established an\\nempire of desolation that did not survive his death.': 290, 'In 1505, however, a descendant of this Timur, an adventurer\\nnamed Baber, got together an army with guns and swept down upon the plains of India.': 468, 'His grandson Akbar\\n15561605 completed his conquests, and this Mongol or Mogul as the Arabs called it dynasty ruled in Delhi\\nover the greater part of India until the eighteenth century.': 479, 'One of the consequences of the first great sweep of Mongol conquest in the thirteenth century was to drive a\\ncertain tribe of Turks, the Ottoman Turks, out of Turkestan into Asia Minor.': 1029, 'They extended and consolidated their\\npower in Asia Minor, crossed the Dardanelles and conquered Macedonia, Serbia and Bulgaria, until at last\\nConstantinople remained like an island amongst the Ottoman dominions.': 525, 'In 1453 the Ottoman Sultan,\\nMuhammad II, took Constantinople, attacking it from the European side with a great number of guns.': 582, 'This event\\ncaused intense excitement in Europe and there was talk of a crusade, but the day of the crusades was past.': 122, 'In the course of the sixteenth century the Ottoman Sultans conquered Bagdad, Hungary, Egypt and most of North\\nAfrica, and their fleet made them masters of the Mediterranean.': 502, 'They very nearly took Vienna, and they exacted a\\ntribute from the Emperor.': 85, 'There were but two items to offset the general ebb of Christian dominion in theA Short History of the World.': 190,

broke the pride of the Ottomans, and restored\\nthe Mediterranean waters to Christian ascendancy.': 100, 'The Intellectual Revival of the Europeans\\nTHROUGHOUT the twelfth century there were many signs that the European intelligence was recovering\\ncourage and leisure, and preparing to take up again the intellectual enterprises of the first Greek scientific\\nenquiries and such speculations as those of the Italian Lucretius.': 737, 'The causes of this revival were many and\\ncomplex.': 134, 'The suppression of private war, the higher standards of comfort and security that followed the crusades,\\nand the stimulation of mens minds by the experiences of these expeditions were no doubt necessary preliminary\\nconditions.': 400, 'Trade was reviving cities were recovering ease and safety the standard of education was arising in\\nthe church and spreading among laymen.': 277, 'The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were a period of growing,\\nindependent or quasiindependent cities Venice, Florence, Genoa, Lisbon, Paris, Bruges, London, Antwerp,\\nHamburg, Nuremberg, Novgorod, Wisby and Bergen for example.': 332, 'They were all trading cities with many\\ntravellers, and where men trade and travel they talk and think.': 466, 'The polemics of the Popes and princes, the\\nconspicuous savagery and wickedness of the persecution of heretics, were exciting men to doubt the authority of\\nthe church and question and discuss fundamental things.': 472, 'We have seen how the Arabs were the means of restoring Aristotle to Europe, and how such a prince as Frederick\\nII acted as a channel through which Arabic philosophy and science played upon the renascent European mind.': 506, 'Still more influential in the stirring up of mens ideas were the Jews.': 116, 'Their very existence was a note of\\ninterrogation to the claims of the church.': 137, 'And finally the secret, fascinating enquiries of the alchemists were\\nspreading far and wide and setting men to the petty, furtive and yet fruitful resumption of experimental science.': 511, 'And the stir in mens minds was by no means confined now to the independent and well educated.': 142, 'The mind of\\nthe common man was awake in the world as it had never been before in all the experience of mankind.': 921, 'In spite of\\npriest and persecution, Christianity does seem to have carried a mental ferment wherever its teaching reached.': 257, 'It\\nestablished a direct relation between the conscience of the individual man and the God of Righteousness, so that\\nnow if need arose he had the courage to form his own judgment upon prince or prelate or creed.': 607, 'As early as the eleventh century philosophical discussion had begun again in Europe, and there were great and\\ngrowing universities at Paris, Oxford, Bologna and other centres.': 806, 'There medieval schoolmen took up again and\\nthrashed out a series of questions upon the value and meaning of words that were a necessary preliminary to clear\\nthinking in the scientific age that was to follow.': 608, 'And standing by himself because of his distinctive genius was\\nRoger Bacon circa 1210 to circa 1293, a Franciscan of Oxford, the father of modern experimental science.': 149, 'His\\nname deserves a prominence in our history second only to that of Aristotle.': 357, 'His writings are one long tirade against ignorance.': 338, 'He told his age it was ignorant, an incredibly bold thing to do.': 219, 'Nowadays a man may tell the world it is as silly as it is solemn, that all its methods are still infantile and clumsy\\nand its dogmas childish assumptions, without much physical danger but these peoples of the middle ages when\\nthey were not actually being massacred or starving or dying of pestilence, were passionately convinced of the\\nwisdom, the completeness and finality of their beliefs, and disposed to resent any reflections upon them very\\nbitterly.': 1681, 'Roger Bacons writings were like a flash of light in a profound darkness.': 183, 'He combined his attack upon the\\nignorance of his times with a wealth of suggestion for the increase of knowledge.': 425, 'In his passionate insistence\\nupon the need of experiment and of collecting knowledge, the spirit of Aristotle lives again in him.': 434, 'Experiment,\\nexperiment, that is the burthen of Roger Bacon.A Short History of the World.': 17, 'The Intellectual Revival of the Europeans 90Yet of Aristotle himself Roger Bacon fell foul.': 38, 'He fell foul of him because men, instead of facing facts boldly, sat\\nin rooms and pored over the bad Latin translations which were then all that was available of the master.': 292, 'If I had\\nmy way, he wrote, in his intemperate fashion, I should burn all the books of Aristotle, for the study of them can\\nonly lead to a loss of time, produce error, and increase ignorance, a sentiment that Aristotle would probably have\\nechoed could he have returned to a world in which his works were not so much read as worshippedand that, as\\nRoger Bacon showed, in these most abominable translations.': 1376, 'Throughout his books, a little disguised by the necessity of seeming to square it all with orthodoxy for fear of the\\nprison and worse, Roger Bacon shouted to mankind, Cease to be ruled by dogmas and authorities look at the\\nworld Four chief sources of ignorance he denounced respect for authority, custom, the sense of the ignorant\\ncrowd, and the vain, proud unteachableness of our dispositions.': 855, 'Overcome but these, and a world of power would\\nopen to men\\nMachines for navigating are possible without rowers, so that great ships suited to river or ocean, guided by one\\nman, may be borne with greater speed than if they were full of men.': 2366, 'Likewise cars may be made so that without a\\ndraught animal they may be moved cum impetu inoestimable, as we deem the scythed chariots to have been from\\nwhich antiquity fought.': 513, 'And flying machines are possible, so that a man may sit in the middle turning some\\ndevice by which artificial wings may beat the air in the manner of a flying bird.': 518, 'So Roger Bacon wrote, but three more centuries were to elapse before men began any systematic attempts to\\nexplore the hidden stores of power and interest he realized so clearly existed beneath the dull surface of human\\naffairs.': 830, 'But the Saracenic world not only gave Christendom the stimulus of its philosophers and alchemists it also gave it\\npaper.': 685, 'It is scarcely too much to say that paper made the intellectual revival of Europe possible.': 458, 'Paper originated\\nin China, where its use probably goes back to the second century B.C.': 398, 'In 751 the Chinese made an attack upon the\\nArab Moslems in Samarkand they were repulsed, and among the prisoners taken from them were some skilled\\npapermakers, from whom the art was learnt.': 623, 'Arabic paper manuscripts from the ninth century onward still exist.': 423, 'The manufacture entered Christendom either through Greece or by the capture of Moorish papermills during the\\nChristian reconquest of Spain.': 51, 'But under the Christian Spanish the product deteriorated sadly.': 6, 'Good paper was\\nnot made in Christian Europe until the end of the thirteenth century, and then it was Italy which led the world.': 981, 'Only by the fourteenth century did the manufacture reach Germany, and not until the end of that century was it\\nabundant and cheap enough for the printing of books to be a practicable business proposition.': 599, 'Thereupon printing\\nfollowed naturally and necessarily, for printing is the most obvious of inventions, and the intellectual life of the\\nworld entered upon a new and far more vigorous phase.': 1549, 'It ceased to be a little trickle from mind to mind it\\nbecame a broad flood, in which thousands and presently scores and hundreds of thousands of minds participated.': 472, 'One immediate result of this achievement of printing was the appearance of an abundance of Bibles in the world.': 532, 'Another was a cheapening of schoolbooks.': 3, 'The knowledge of reading spread swiftly.': 121, 'There was not only a great\\nincrease of books in the world, but the books that were now made were plainer to read and so easier to\\nunderstand.': 1224, 'Instead of toiling at a crabbed text and then thinking over its significance, readers now could think\\nunimpeded as they read.': 159, 'With this increase in the facility of reading, the reading public grew.': 105, 'The book ceased to\\nbe a highly decorated toy or a scholars mystery.': 53, 'People began to write books to be read as well as looked at by\\nordinary people.': 428, 'They wrote in the ordinary language and not in Latin.': 67, 'With the fourteenth century the real\\nhistory of the European literature begins.': 558, 'So far we have been dealing only with the Saracenic share in the European revival.': 142, 'Let us turn now to the\\ninfluence of the Mongol conquests.': 100, 'They stimulated the geographical imagination of Europe enormously.': 33, 'For a\\ntime under the Great Khan, all Asia and Western Europe enjoyed an open intercourse all the roads were\\ntemporarily open, and representatives of every nation appeared at the court of Karakorum.': 388, 'The barriers between\\nEurope and Asia set up by the religious feud of Christianity and Islam were lowered.': 133, 'Great hopes wereA Short History of the World.': 2, 'The Intellectual Revival of the Europeans 91entertained by the papacy for the conversion of the Mongols to Christianity.': 9, 'Their only religion so far had been\\nShumanism, a primitive paganism.': 201, 'Envoys of the Pope, Buddhist priests from India, Parisian and Italian and\\nChinese artificers, Byzantine and Armenian merchants, mingled with Arab officials and Persian and Indian\\nastronomers and mathematicians at the Mongol court.': 112, 'We hear too much in history of the campaigns and\\nmassacres of the Mongols, and not enough of their curiosity and desire for learning.': 483, 'Not perhaps as an originative\\npeople, but as transmitters of knowledge and method their influence upon the worlds history has been very great.': 1390, 'And everything one can learn of the vague and romantic personalities of Jengis or Kublai tends to confirm the\\nimpression that these men were at least as understanding and creative monarchs as either that flamboyant but\\negotistical figure Alexander the Great or that raiser of political ghosts, that energetic but illiterate theologian\\nCharlemagne.': 676, 'One of the most interesting of these visitors to the Mongol Court was a certain Venetian, Marco Polo, who\\nafterwards set down his story in a book.': 212, 'He went to China about 1272 with his father and uncle, who had already\\nonce made the journey.': 377, 'The Great Khan had been deeply impressed by the elder Polos they were the first men of\\nthe Latin peoples he had seen and he sent them back with enquiries for teachers and learned men who could\\nexplain Christianity to him, and for various other European things that had aroused his curiosity.': 1101, 'Their visit with\\nMarco was their second visit.': 47, 'The three Polos started by way of Palestine and not by the Crimea, as in their previous expedition.': 126, 'They had with\\nthem a gold tablet and other indications from the Great Khan that must have greatly facilitated their journey.': 104, 'The\\nGreat Khan had asked for some oil from the lamp that burns in the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem and so thither\\nthey first went, and then by way of Cilicia into Armenia.': 431, 'They went thus far north because the Sultan of Egypt\\nwas raiding the Mongol domains at this time.': 509, 'Thence they came by way of Mesopotamia to Ormuz on the Persian\\nGulf, as if they contemplated a sea voyage.': 308, 'At Ormuz they met merchants from India.': 18, 'For some reason they did\\nnot take ship, but instead turned northward through the Persian deserts, and so by way of Balkh over the Pamir to\\nKashgar, and by way of Kotan and the Lob Nor into the Hwangho valley and on to Pekin.': 251, 'At Pekin was the\\nGreat Khan, and they were hospitably entertained.': 4, 'Marco particularly pleased Kublai he was young and clever, and it is clear he had mastered the Tartar language\\nvery thoroughly.': 122, 'He was given an official position and sent on several missions, chiefly in southwest China.': 91, 'The\\ntale he had to tell of vast stretches of smiling and prosperous country, all the way excellent hostelries for\\ntravellers, and fine vineyards, fields and gardens, of many abbeys of Buddhist monks, of manufactures of\\ncloth of silk and gold and many fine taffetas, a constant succession of cities and boroughs, and so on, first\\nroused the incredulity and then fired the imagination of all Europe.': 888, 'He told of Burmah, and of its great armies\\nwith hundreds of elephants, and how these animals were defeated by the Mongol bowmen, and also of the\\nMongol conquest of Pegu.': 734, 'He told of Japan, and greatly exaggerated the amount of gold in that country.': 129, 'For three\\nyears Marco ruled the city of Yangchow as governor, and he probably impressed the Chinese inhabitants as\\nbeing very little more of a foreigner than any Tartar would have been.': 644, 'He may also have been sent on a mission to\\nIndia.': 233, 'Chinese records mention a certain Polo attached to the imperial council in 1277, a very valuable\\nconfirmation of the general truth of the Polo story.': 193, 'The publication of Marco Polos travels produced a profound effect upon the European imagination.': 361, 'The\\nEuropean literature, and especially the European romance of the fifteenth century, echoes with the names in\\nMarco Polos story, with Cathay North China and Cambulac Pekin and the like.': 425, 'Two centuries later, among the readers of the Travels of Marco Polo was a certain Genoese mariner, Christopher\\nColumbus, who conceived the brilliant idea of sailing westward round the world to China.': 857, 'In Seville there is a\\ncopy of the Travels with marginal notes by Columbus.': 4, 'There were many reasons why the thought of a Genoese\\nshould be turned in this direction.': 188, 'Until its capture by the Turks in 1453 Constantinople had been an impartial\\ntrading mart between the Western world and the East, and the Genoese had traded there freely.': 529, 'But the Latin\\nVenetians, the bitter rivals of the Genoese, had been the allies and helpers of the Turks against the Greeks, andA Short History of the World.': 30, 'The Intellectual Revival of the Europeans 92with the coming of the Turks Constantinople turned an unfriendly face upon Genoese trade.': 388, 'The long forgotten\\ndiscovery that the world was round had gradually resumed its sway over mens minds.': 692, 'The idea of going\\nwestward to China was therefore a fairly obvious one.': 357, 'It was encouraged by two things.': 191, 'The mariners compass\\nhad now been invented and men were no longer left to the mercy of a fine night and the stars to determine the\\ndirection in which they were sailing, and the Normans, Catalonians and Genoese and Portuguese had already\\npushed out into the Atlantic as far as the Canary Isles, Madeira and the Azores.': 535, 'Yet Columbus found many difficulties before he could get ships to put his idea to the test.': 396, 'He went from one\\nEuropean Court to another.': 390, 'Finally at Granada, just won from the Moors, he secured the patronage of Ferdinand\\nand Isabella, and was able to set out across the unknown ocean in three small ships.': 298, 'After a voyage of two months\\nand nine days he came to a land which he believed to be India, but which was really a new continent, whose\\ndistinct existence the old world had never hitherto suspected.': 1444, 'He returned to Spain with gold, cotton, strange\\nbeasts and birds, and two wildeyed painted Indians to be baptized.': 212, 'They were called Indians because, to the end\\nof his days, he believed that this land he had found was India.': 360, 'Only in the course of several years did men begin to\\nrealize that the whole new continent of America was added to the worlds resources.': 782, 'The success of Columbus stimulated overseas enterprise enormously.': 52, 'In 1497 the Portuguese sailed round Africa\\nto India, and in 1515 there were Portuguese ships in Java.': 84, 'In 1519 Magellan, a Portuguese sailor in Spanish\\nemployment, sailed out of Seville westward with five ships, of which one, the Vittoria, came back up the river to\\nSeville in 1522, the first ship that had ever circumnavigated the world.': 1352, 'Thirtyone men were aboard her,\\nsurvivors of twohundredandeighty who had started.': 206, 'Magellan himself had been killed in the Philippine Isles.': 17, 'Printed paper books, a new

had restored it but under both Pagan and Catholic Rome curiosity and\\ninnovation were subordinate to and restrained by organization.': 430, 'The reign of the Latin mind was now drawing to\\nan end.': 155, 'Between the thirteenth and the sixteenth century the European Aryans, thanks to the stimulating influence\\nof Semite and Mongol and the rediscovery of the Greek classics, broke away from the Latin tradition and rose\\nagain to the intellectual and material leadership of mankind.': 493, 'L.

very definite upward limit, therefore, to the size of cannon.': 57, 'The blastfurnace rose in the eighteenth century and developed with the use of coke.': 329, 'Not before the eighteenth\\ncentury do we find rolled sheet iron 1728 and rolled rods and bars 1783.': 330, 'Nasmyths steam hammer came as\\nlate as 1838.': 178, 'The ancient world, because of its metallurgical inferiority, could not use steam.': 676, 'The steam engine, even the\\nprimitive pumping engine, could not develop before sheet iron was available.': 309, 'The early engines seem to the\\nmodern eye very pitiful and clumsy bits of ironmongery, but they were the utmost that the metallurgical science\\nof the time could do.': 556, 'As late as 1856 came the Bessemer process, and presently 1864 the openhearth process,\\nin which steel and every sort of iron could be melted, purified and cast in a manner and upon a scale hitherto\\nunheard of.': 864, 'Today in the electric furnace one may see tons of incandescent steel swirling about like boiling milk\\nin a saucepan.': 520, 'Nothing in the previous practical advances of mankind is comparable in its consequences to the\\ncomplete mastery over enormous masses of steel and iron and over their texture and quality which man has now\\nachieved.': 374, 'The railways and early engines of all sorts were the mere first triumphs of the new metallurgical\\nmethods.': 684, 'Presently came ships of iron and steel, vast bridges, and a new way of building with steel upon a\\ngigantic scale.': 930, 'Men realized too late that they had planned their railways with far too timid a gauge, that they\\ncould have organized their travelling with far more steadiness and comfort upon a much bigger scale.': 811, 'Before the nineteenth century there were no ships in the world much over 2,000 tons burthen now there is\\nnothing wonderful about a 50,000ton liner.': 932, 'There are people who sneer at this kind of progress as being a\\nprogress in mere size, but that sort of sneering merely marks the intellectual limitations of those who indulge in\\nit.': 454, 'The great ship or the steelframe building is not, as they imagine, a magnified version of the small ship or\\nbuilding of the past it is a thing different in kind, more lightly and strongly built, of finer and stronger materials\\ninstead of being a thing of precedent and ruleofthumb, it is a thing of subtle and intricate calculation.': 892, 'In the old\\nhouse or ship, matter was dominantthe material and its needs had to be slavishly obeyed in the new, matter had\\nbeen captured, changed,

six\\nhundred feet above the crowded city\\nWe have given these particulars of the advance in mans knowledge of the metallurgy of steel and its results by\\nway of illustration.': 528, 'A parallel story could be told of the metallurgy of copper and tin, and of a multitude of metals,\\nnickel and aluminum to name but two, unknown before the nineteenth century dawned.': 607, 'It is in this great and\\ngrowing mastery over substances, over different sorts of glass, over rocks and plasters and the like, over colours\\nand textures, that the main triumphs of the mechanical revolution have thus far been achieved.': 939, 'Yet we are still in\\nthe stage of the first fruits in the matter.': 489, 'We have the power, but we have still to learn how to use our power.': 466, 'Many of the first employments of these gifts of science have been vulgar, tawdry, stupid or horrible.': 332, 'The artist\\nand the adaptor have still hardly begun to work with the endless variety of substances now at their disposal.': 274, 'Parallel with this extension of mechanical possibilities the new science of electricity grew up.': 413, 'It was only in the\\neighties of the nineteenth century that this body of enquiry began to yield results to impress the vulgar mind.': 425, 'Then\\nsuddenly came electric light and electric traction, and the transmutation of forces, the possibility of sending\\npower, that could be changed into mechanical motion or light or heat as one chose, along a copper wire, as water\\nis sent along a pipe, began to come through to the ideas of ordinary people.': 1367, 'The British and French were at first the leading peoples in this great proliferation of knowledge but presently the\\nGermans, who had learnt humility under Napoleon, showed such zeal and pertinacity in scientific enquiry as to\\noverhaul these leaders.': 1031, 'British science was largely the creation of Englishmen and Scotchmen working outside the\\nordinary centres of erudition.A Short History of

Latin and Greek classics.': 357, 'French education, too, was dominated by the classical tradition of the\\nJesuit schools, and consequently it was not difficult for the Germans to organize a body of investigators, small\\nindeed in relation to the possibilities of the case, but large in proportion to the little band of British and French\\ninventors and experimentalists.': 401, 'And though this work of research and experiment was making Britain and France\\nthe most rich and powerful countries in the world, it was not making scientific and inventive men rich and\\npowerful.': 959, 'There is a necessary unworldliness about a sincere scientific man he is too preoccupied with his\\nresearch to plan and scheme how to make money out of it.': 315, 'The economic exploitation of his discoveries falls very\\neasily and naturally, therefore, into the hands of a more acquisitive type and so we find that the crops of rich men\\nwhich every fresh phase of scientific and technical progress has produced in Great Britain, though they have not\\ndisplayed quite the same passionate desire to insult and kill the goose that laid the national golden eggs as the\\nscholastic and clerical professions, have been quite content to let that profitable creature starve.': 825, 'Inventors and\\ndiscoverers came by nature, they thought, for cleverer people to profit by.': 459, 'In this matter the Germans were a little wiser.': 122, 'The German learned did not display the same vehement hatred of\\nthe new learning.': 302, 'They permitted its development.': 76, 'The German business man and manufacturer again had not\\nquite the same contempt for the man of science as had his British competitor.': 446, 'Knowledge, these Germans\\nbelieved, might be a cultivated crop, responsive to fertilizers.': 60, 'They did concede, therefore, a certain amount of\\nopportunity to the scientific mind their public expenditure on scientific work was relatively greater, and this\\nexpenditure was abundantly rewarded.': 342, 'By the latter half of the nineteenth century the German scientific worker\\nhad made German a necessary language for every science student who wished to keep abreast with the latest work\\nin his department, and in certain branches, and particularly in chemistry, Germany acquired a very great\\nsuperiority over her western neighbours.': 1382, 'The scientific effort of the sixties and seventies in Germany began to tell\\nafter the eighties, and the German gained steadily upon Britain and France in technical and industrial prosperity.': 508, 'A fresh phase in the history of invention opened when in the eighties a new type of engine came into use, an\\nengine in which the expansive force of an explosive mixture replaced the expansive force of steam.': 934, 'The light,\\nhighly efficient engines that were thus made possible were applied to the automobile, and developed at last to\\nreach such a pitch of lightness and efficiency as to render flightlong known

Washington as early as 1897.': 503, 'By 1909 the aeroplane was\\navailable for human locomotion.': 152, 'There had seemed to be a pause in the increase of human speed with the\\nperfection of railways and automobile road traction, but with the flying machine came fresh reductions in the\\neffective distance between one point of the earths surface and another.': 780, 'In the eighteenth century the distance from\\nLondon to Edinburgh was an eight days journey in 1918 the British Civil Air Transport Commission reported\\nthat the journey from London to Melbourne, halfway round the earth, would probably in a few years time be\\naccomplished in that same period of eight days.': 1177, 'Too much stress must not be laid upon these striking reductions in the time distances of one place from another.': 1032, 'They are merely one aspect of a much profounder and more momentous enlargement of human possibility.': 567, 'The\\nscience of agriculture and agricultural chemistry, for instance, made quite parallel advances during the nineteenth\\ncentury.': 584, 'Men learnt so to fertilize the soil as to produce quadruple and quintuple the crops got from the same area\\nin the seventeenth century.': 304, 'There was a still more extraordinary advance in medical science the average duration\\nof life rose, the daily efficiency increased, the waste of life through illhealth diminished.': 771, 'Now here altogether we have such a change in human life as to constitute a fresh phase of history.': 786, 'In a little more\\nthan a century this mechanical revolution has been brought about.': 416, 'In that time man made a stride in the material\\nconditions of his life vaster than he had done during the whole long interval between the palaeolithic stage and the\\nage of cultivation, or between the days of Pepi in Egypt and those of George III.': 1263, 'A new gigantic material\\nframework for human affairs has come into existence.': 558, 'Clearly it demands great readjustments of our

here called the mechanical revolution,\\nwhich was an entirely new thing in human experience arising out of the development of organized science, a new\\nstep like the invention of agriculture or the discovery of metals, with something else, quite different in its origins,\\nsomething for which there was already an historical precedent, the social and financial development which is\\ncalled the industrial revolution.': 1867, 'The two processes were going on together, they were constantly reacting upon\\neach other, but they were in root and essence different.': 547, 'There would have been an industrial revolution of sorts if\\nthere had been no coal, no steam, no machinery but in that case it would probably have followed far more closely\\nupon the lines of the social and financial developments of the later years of the Roman Republic.': 1307, 'It would have\\nrepeated the story of dispossessed free cultivators, gang labour, great estates, great financial fortunes, and a\\nsocially destructive financial process.': 1254, 'Even the factory method came before power and machinery.': 315, 'Factories were\\nthe product not of machinery, but of the division of labour.': 43, 'Drilled and sweated workers were making such\\nthings as millinery cardboard boxes and furniture, and colouring maps and book illustrations and so forth, before\\neven waterwheels had been used for industrial purposes.': 287, 'There were factories in Rome in the days of Augustus.': 76, 'New books, for instance, were dictated to rows of copyists in the factories of the booksellers.': 51, 'The attentive\\nstudent of Defoe and of the political pamphlets of Fielding will realize that the idea of herding poor people into\\nestablishments to work collectively for their living was already current in Britain before the close of the\\nseventeenth century.': 878, 'There are intimations of it even as early as Mores Utopia 1516.': 163, 'It was a social and not a\\nmechanical development.': 166, 'Up to past the middle of the eighteenth century the social and economic history of western Europe was in fact\\nretreading the path along which the Roman state had gone in the last three centuries B.C.': 1134, 'But the political\\ndisunions of Europe, the political convulsions against monarchy, the recalcitrance of the common folk and\\nperhaps also the greater accessibility of the western European intelligence to mechanical ideas and inventions,\\nturned the process into quite novel directions.': 816, 'Ideas of human solidarity, thanks to Christianity, were far more\\nwidely diffused in the newer European world, political power was not so concentrated, and the man of energy\\nanxious to get rich turned his mind, therefore, very willingly from the ideas of the slave and of gang labour to the\\nidea of mechanical power and the machine.': 1645, 'The mechanical revolution, the process of mechanical invention and discovery, was a new thing in human\\nexperience and it went on regardless of the social, political, economic and industrial consequences it might\\nproduce.': 969, 'The industrial revolution, on the other hand, like most other human affairs, was and is more and more\\nprofoundly changed and deflected by the constant variation in human conditions caused by the mechanical\\nrevolution.': 703, 'And the essential difference between the amassing of riches, the extinction of small farmers and small\\nbusiness men, and the phase of big finance in the latter centuries of the Roman Republic on the one hand, and the\\nvery similar concentration of capital in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries on the other, lies in the profound\\ndifference in the character of labour that the mechanical revolution was bringing about.': 1128, 'The power of the old\\nworld was human power everything depended ultimately upon the driving power of human muscle, the muscle of\\nignorant and subjugated men.': 1767, 'A little animal muscle, supplied by draft oxen, horse traction and the like,\\ncontributed.': 280, 'Where a weight had to be lifted, men lifted it where a rock had to be quarried, men chipped it out\\nwhere a field had to be ploughed, men and oxen ploughed it the Roman equivalent of the steamship was the\\ngalley with its bank of sweating rowers.': 664, 'A vast proportion of mankind in the early civilizations were employed in\\npurely mechanical drudgery.': 255, 'At its onset, powerdriven machinery did not seem to promise any release from such\\nunintelligent toil.': 73, 'Great gangs of men were employed in excavating canals, in making railway cuttings and\\nembankments, and the like.': 382, 'The number of miners increased enormously.': 80, 'But the extension of facilities and the\\noutput of commodities increased much more.': 186, 'And as the nineteenth century went on, the plain logic of the new\\nsituation asserted itself more clearly.': 626, 'Human beings were no longer wanted as a source of mere

'The\\nhuman being was needed now only where choice and intelligence had to be exercised.': 181, 'Human beings were\\nwanted only as human beings.': 189, 'The drudge, on whom all the previous civilizations had rested, the creature of mere\\nobedience, the man whose brains were superfluous, had become unnecessary to the welfare of mankind.': 369, 'This was as true of such ancient industries as agriculture and mining as it was of the newest metallurgical\\nprocesses.': 125, 'For ploughing, sowing and harvesting, swift machines came forward to do the work of scores of men.': 449, 'The Roman civilization was built upon cheap and degraded human beings modern civilization is being rebuilt\\nupon cheap mechanical power.': 1069, 'For a hundred years power has been getting cheaper and labour dearer.': 354, 'If for a\\ngeneration or so machinery has had to wait its turn in the mine, it is simply because for a time men were cheaper\\nthan machinery.': 466, 'Now here was a changeover of quite primary importance in human affairs.': 255, 'The chief solicitude of the rich and of\\nthe ruler in the old civilization had been to keep up a supply of drudges.': 239, 'As the nineteenth century went on, it\\nbecame more and more plain to the intelligent directive people that the common man had now to be something\\nbetter than a drudge.': 980, 'He had to be educatedif only to secure industrial efficiency.': 27, 'He had to understand what\\nhe was about.': 10, 'From the days of the first Christian propaganda, popular education had been smouldering in\\nEurope, just as it had smouldered in Asia wherever Islam has set its foot, because of the necessity of making the\\nbeliever understand a little of the belief by which he is saved, and of enabling him to read a little in the sacred\\nbooks by which his belief is conveyed.': 792, 'Christian controversies, with their competition for adherents, ploughed the\\nground for the harvest of popular education.': 74, 'In England, for instance, by the thirties and forties of the nineteenth\\ncentury, the disputes of the sects and the necessity of catching adherents young had produced a series of\\ncompeting educational organizations for children, the church National schools, the dissenting British schools,\\nand even Roman Catholic elementary schools.': 582, 'The second half of the nineteenth century was a period of rapid\\nadvance in popular education throughout all the Westernized world.': 979, 'There was no parallel advance in the\\neducation of the upper classessome advance, no doubt, but nothing to correspondand so the great gulf that had\\ndivided that world hitherto into the readers and the nonreading mass became little more than a slightly\\nperceptible difference in educational level.': 1370, 'At the back of this process was the mechanical revolution, apparently\\nregardless of social conditions, but really insisting inexorably upon the complete abolition of a totally illiterate\\nclass throughout the world.': 1165, 'The economic revolution of the Roman Republic had never been clearly apprehended by the common people of\\nRome.': 456, 'The ordinary Roman citizen never saw the changes through which he lived, clearly and comprehensively\\nas we see them.': 205, 'But the industrial revolution, as it went on towards the end of the nineteenth century, was more\\nand more distinctly seen as one whole process by the common people it was affecting, because presently they\\ncould read and discuss and communicate, and because they went about and saw things as no commonalty had ever\\ndone before.': 1566, 'The Development of Modern Political and Social Ideas\\nTHE INSTITUTIONS and customs and political ideas of the ancient civilizations grew up slowly, age by age, no\\nman designing and no man foreseeing.': 940, 'It was only in that great century of human adolescence, the sixth century\\nB.C., that men began to think clearly about their relations to one another, and first to question and first propose to\\nalter and rearrange the established beliefs and laws and methods of human government.': 2460, 'We have told of the glorious intellectual dawn of Greece and Alexandria, and how presently the collapse of the\\nslaveholding civilizations and the clouds of religious intolerance and absolutist government darkened the\\npromise of that beginning.': 337, 'The light of fearless thinking did not break through the European obscurity again\\neffectually until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.': 166, 'We have tried to show something

inextricably\\nwith much emotional matter.': 615, 'The advances made in them have been slower and made against greater opposition.': 412, 'Men will listen dispassionately to the most diverse suggestions about stars or molecules, but ideas about our ways\\nof life touch and reflect upon everyone about us.': 679, 'And just as in Greece the bold speculations of Plato came before Aristotles

Mores Utopia is a curious imitation of Plato that bore fruit in a new English\\npoor law.': 318, 'The Neapolitan Campanellas City of the Sun was more fantastic and less fruitful.': 57, 'By the end of the seventeenth century we find a considerable and growing literature of political and social science\\nwas being produced.': 690, 'Among the pioneers in this discussion was John Locke, the son of an English republican, an\\nOxford scholar who first directed his attention to chemistry and medicine.': 355, 'His treatises on government, toleration\\nand education show a mind fully awake to the possibilities of social reconstruction.': 270, 'Parallel with and a little later\\nthan John Locke in England, Montesquieu 16891755 in France subjected social, political and religious\\ninstitutions to a searching and fundamental analysis.': 407, 'He stripped the magical prestige from the absolutist\\nmonarchy in France.': 47, 'He shares with Locke the credit for clearing away many of the false ideas that had hitherto\\nprevented deliberate and conscious attempts to reconstruct human society.': 436, 'The generation that followed him in the middle and later decades of the eighteenth century was boldly speculative\\nupon the moral and intellectual clearings he had made.': 909, 'A group of brilliant writers, the Encyclopaedists, mostly\\nrebel spirits from the excellent schools of the Jesuits, set themselves to scheme out a new world 1766.': 874, 'Side by\\nside with the Encyclopaedists were the Economists or Physiocrats, who were making bold and crude enquiries\\ninto the production and distribution of food and goods.': 105, 'Morelly, the author of the Code de la Nature, denounced\\nthe institution of private property and proposed a communistic organization of society.': 114, 'He was the precursor of\\nthat large and various school of collectivist thinkers in the nineteenth century who are lumped together as\\nSocialists.': 374, 'What is Socialism There are a hundred definitions of Socialism and a thousand sects of Socialists.': 96, 'Essentially\\nSocialism is no more and no less than a criticism of the idea of property in the light of the public good.': 206, 'We may\\nreview the history of that idea through the ages very briefly.': 462, 'That and the idea of internationalism are the two\\ncardinal ideas upon which most of our political life is turning.': 867, 'The idea of property arises out of the combative instincts of the species.': 113, 'Long before men were men, the ancestral\\nape was a proprietor.': 407, 'Primitive property is what a beast will fight for.': 58, 'The dog and his bone, the tigress and her\\nlair, the roaring stag and his herd, these are proprietorship blazing.': 21, 'No more nonsensical expression is conceivable\\nin sociology than the term primitive communism.': 77, 'The Old Man of the family tribe of early palaelithic times\\ninsisted upon his proprietorship in his wives and daughters, in his tools, in his visible universe.': 437, 'If any other man\\nwandered into his visible universe he fought him, and if he could he slew him.': 312, 'The tribe grew in the course of\\nages, as Atkinson showed convincingly in his Primal Law, by the gradual toleration by the Old Man of the\\nexistence of the younger men, and of their proprietorship in the wives they captured from outside the tribe, and in\\nthe tools and ornaments they made and the game they slew.': 599, 'Human society grew by a compromise between this\\nones property and that.': 110, 'It was a compromise with instinct which was forced upon men by the necessity of driving\\nsome other tribe out of its visible universe.': 542, 'If the hills and forests and streams were not your land or my land, it\\nwas because they had to be our land.': 258, 'Each of us would have preferred to have it my land, but that would not work.': 537, 'In that case the other fellows would have destroyed us.': 273, 'Society, therefore, is from its beginning a mitigation of\\nownership.': 54, 'Ownership in the beast and in the primitive savage was far more intense a thing than it is in the\\ncivilized world today.': 795, 'It is rooted more strongly in our instincts than in our reason.A Short History of the World.': 10, 'The Development of Modern Political and Social Ideas 117In the natural savage and in the untutored man today there is no limitation to the sphere of ownership.': 260, 'Whatever\\nyou can fight for, you can own womenfolk, spared captive, captured beast, forest glade, stonepit or what not.': 51, 'As the community grew, a sort of law came to restrain internecine fighting, men developed roughandready\\nmethods of settling proprietorship.': 591, 'Men could own what they were the first to make or capture or claim.': 422, 'It seemed\\nnatural that a debtor who could not pay should become the property of his creditor.': 231, 'Equally natural was it that\\nafter claiming a patch of land a man should exact payments from anyone who wanted to use it.': 331, 'It was only slowly,\\nas the possibilities of organized life dawned on men, that this unlimited property in anything whatever began to be\\nrecognized as a nuisance.': 626, 'Men found themselves born into a universe all owned and claimed, nay they found\\nthemselves born owned and claimed.': 244, 'The social struggles of the earlier civilization are difficult to trace now, but\\nthe history we have told of the Roman Republic shows a community waking up to the idea that debts may become\\na public inconvenience and should then be repudiated, and that the unlimited ownership of land is also an\\ninconvenience.': 948, 'We find that later Babylonia severely limited the rights of property in slaves.': 193, 'Finally, we find in\\nthe teaching of that great revolutionist, Jesus of Nazareth, such an attack upon property as had never been before.': 949, 'Easier it was, he said, for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the owner of great possessions to\\nenter the kingdom of heaven.': 614, 'A steady, continuous criticism of the permissible scope of property seems to have\\nbeen going on in the world for the last twentyfive or thirty centuries.': 797, 'Nineteen hundred years after Jesus of\\nNazareth we find all the world that has come under the Christian teaching persuaded that there could be no\\nproperty in human beings.': 1115, 'And also the idea that a man may do what he likes with his own was very much\\nshaken in relation to other sorts of property.': 605, 'But this world of the closing eighteenth century was still only in the interrogative stage in this matter.': 930, 'It had got\\nnothing clear enough, much less settled enough, to act upon.': 594, 'One of its primary impulses was to protect property\\nagainst the greed and waste of kings and the exploitation of noble adventurers.': 132, 'It was largely to protect private\\nproperty from taxation that the French Revolution began.': 176, 'But the equalitarian formulae of the Revolution carried\\nit into a criticism of the very property it had risen to protect.': 95, 'How can men be free and equal when numbers of\\nthem have no ground to stand upon and nothing to eat, and the owners will neither feed nor lodge them unless\\nthey toil Excessivelythe poor complained.': 634, 'To which riddle the reply of one important political group was to set about dividing up.': 474, 'They wanted to\\nintensify and universalize property.': 50, 'Aiming at the same end by another route, there were the primitive\\nsocialistsor, to be more exact, communistswho wanted to abolish private property altogether.': 323, 'The state a\\ndemocratic state was of course understood was to own all property.': 223, 'It is paradoxical that different men seeking the same ends of liberty and happiness should propose on the one hand\\nto make property as absolute as possible, and on the other to put an end to it altogether.': 828, 'And the\\nclue to this paradox is to be found in the fact that ownership is not one thing but a multitude of different things.': 558, 'It was only as the nineteenth century developed that men began to realize that property was not one simple thing,\\nbut a great complex of ownerships of different values and consequences, that many things such as ones body, the\\nimplements of an artist, clothing, toothbrushes are very profoundly and incurably ones personal property, and\\nthat there is a very great range of things, railways, machinery of various sorts, homes, cultivated gardens, pleasure\\nboats, for example, which need each to be considered very particularly to determine how far and under what\\nlimitations it may come under private ownership, and how far it falls into the public domain and may be\\nadministered and let out by the state in the collective interest.': 3082, 'On the practical side these questions pass into\\npolitics, and the problem of making and sustaining efficient state administration.': 195, 'They open up issues in social\\npsychology, and interact with the enquiries of educational science.': 185, 'The criticism of property is still a vast and\\npassionate ferment rather than a science.': 360, 'On the one hand are the Individualists, who would protect and enlarge\\nour present freedoms with what we possess, and on the other the Socialists who would in many directions pool\\nour ownerships and restrain our proprietary acts.': 790, 'In practice one will find every gradation between the extreme\\nindividualist, who will scarcely tolerate a tax of any sort to support a government, and the communist who would\\ndeny any possessions at all.': 706, 'The ordinary socialist of today is what is called a collectivist he would allow aA Short History of the

of staple articles, and the like, into the hands of a highly organized state.': 458, 'Nowadays there does\\nseem to be a gradual convergence of reasonable men towards a moderate socialism scientifically studied and\\nplanned.': 323, 'It is realized more and more clearly that the untutored man does not cooperate easily and successfully\\nin large undertakings, and that every step towards a more complex state and every function that the state takes\\nover from private enterprise, necessitates a corresponding educational advance and the organization of a proper\\ncriticism and

employer and employed and particularly between selfish employers and\\nreluctant workers, led to a worldwide dissemination of the very harsh and elementary form of communism\\nwhich is associated with the name of Marx.': 358, 'Marx based his theories on a belief that mens minds are limited by\\ntheir economic necessities, and that there is a necessary conflict of interests in our present civilization between the\\nprosperous and employing classes of people and the employed mass.': 519, 'With the advance in education necessitated\\nby the mechanical revolution, this great employed majority will become more and more classconscious and\\nmore and more solid in antagonism to the classconscious ruling minority.': 638, 'In some way the classconscious\\nworkers would seize power, he prophesied, and inaugurate a new social state.': 824, 'The antagonism, the insurrection,\\nthe possible revolution are understandable enough, but it does not follow that a new social state or anything but a\\nsocially destructive process will ensue.': 623, 'Put to the test in Russia, Marxism, as we shall note later, has proved\\nsingularly uncreative.': 101, 'Marx sought to replace national antagonism by class antagonisms Marxism has produced in succession a First, a\\nSecond and a Third Workers International.': 110, 'But from the starting point of modern individualistic thought it is also\\npossible to reach international ideas.': 359, 'From the days of that great English economist, Adam Smith, onward there\\nhas been an increasing realization that for worldwide prosperity free and unencumbered trade about the earth is\\nneeded.': 737, 'The individualist with his hostility to the state is hostile also to tariffs and boundaries and all the restraints\\nupon free act and movement that national boundaries seem to justify.': 663, 'It is interesting to see two lines of thought,\\nso diverse in spirit, so different in substance as this classwar socialism of the Marxists and the individualistic\\nfreetrading philosophy of the British business men of the Victorian age heading at last, in spite of these primary\\ndifferences, towards the same intimations of a new worldwide treatment of human affairs outside the boundaries\\nand limitations of any existing state.': 1464, 'The logic of reality triumphs over the logic of theory.': 22, 'We begin to perceive\\nthat from widely divergent starting points individualist theory and socialist theory are part of a common search, a\\nsearch for more spacious social and political ideas and interpretations, upon which men may contrive to work\\ntogether, a search that began again in Europe and has intensified as mens confidence in the ideas of the Holy\\nRoman Empire and in Christendom decayed, and as the age of discovery broadened their horizons from the world\\nof the Mediterranean to the whole wide world.': 2555, 'To bring this description of the elaboration and development of social, economic and political ideas right down to\\nthe discussions of the present day, would be to introduce issues altogether too controversial for the scope and\\nintentions of this book.': 713, 'But regarding these things, as we do here, from the vast perspectives of the student of\\nworld history, we are bound to recognize that this reconstruction of these directive ideas in the human mind is still\\nan unfinished taskwe cannot even estimate yet how unfinished the task may be.': 1619, 'Certain common beliefs do seem\\nto be emerging, and their influence is very perceptible upon the political events and public acts of today but at\\npresent they are not clear enough nor convincing enough to compel men definitely and systematically towards\\ntheir realization.': 978, 'Mens acts waver between tradition and the new, and on the whole they rather gravitate towards\\nthe traditional.': 452, 'Yet, compared with the thought of even a brief lifetime ago, there does seem to be an outline\\nshaping itself of a new order in human affairs.': 718, 'It is a sketchy outline, vanishing into vagueness at this point and\\nthat, and fluctuating in detail and formulae, yet it grows steadfastly clearer, and its main lines change less and\\nless.A Short History of the World.': 197, 'The Development of Modern Political and Social Ideas 119It is becoming plainer and plainer each year that in many respects and in an increasing range of affairs, mankind is\\nbecoming one community, and that it is more and more necessary that in such matters there should be a common\\nworldwide control.': 693, 'For example, it is steadily truer that the whole planet is now one economic community, that\\nthe proper exploitation of its natural resources demands one comprehensive direction, and that the greater power\\nand range that discovery has given human effort makes the present fragmentary and contentious administration of\\nsuch affairs more and more wasteful and dangerous.': 1142, 'Financial and monetary expedients also become worldwide\\ninterests to be dealt with successfully only on worldwide lines.': 207, 'Infectious diseases and the increase and\\nmigrations of population are also now plainly seen to be worldwide concerns.': 219, 'The greater power and range of\\nhuman activities has also made war disproportionately destructive and disorganizing, and, even as a clumsy way\\nof settling issues between government and government and people and people, ineffective.': 1526, 'All these things\\nclamour for controls and authorities of a greater range and greater comprehensiveness than any government that\\nhas hitherto existed.': 243, 'But it does not follow that the solution of these problems lies in some supergovernment of all the world arising\\nby conquest or by the coalescence of existing governments.': 562, 'By analogy with existing institutions men have\\nthought of the Parliament of Mankind, of a World Congress, of a President or Emperor of the Earth.': 259, 'Our first\\nnatural reaction is towards some such conclusion, but the discussion and experiences of half a century of\\nsuggestions and attempts has on the whole discouraged belief in that first obvious idea.': 1004, 'Along that line to world\\nunity the resistances are too great.': 957, 'The drift of thought seems now to be in the direction of a number of special\\ncommittees or organizations, with worldwide power delegated to them by existing governments in this group of\\nmatters or that, bodies concerned with the waste or development of natural wealth, with the equalization of labour\\nconditions, with world peace, with currency, population and health, and so forth.': 1147, 'The world may discover that all its common interests are being managed as one concern, while it still fails to\\nrealize that a world government exists.': 1616, 'But before even so much human unity is attained, before such international\\narrangements can be put above patriotic suspicions and jealousies, it is necessary that the common mind of the\\nrace should be possessed of that idea of human unity, and that the idea of mankind as one family should be a\\nmatter of universal instruction and understanding.': 1248, 'For a score of centuries or more the spirit of the great universal religions has been struggling to maintain and\\nextend that idea of a universal human brotherhood, but to this day the spites, angers and distrusts of tribal,\\nnational and racial friction obstruct, and successfully obstruct, the broader views and more generous impulses\\nwhich would make every man the servant of all mankind.': 1445, 'The idea of human brotherhood struggles now to\\npossess the human soul, just as the idea of Christendom struggled to possess the soul of Europe in the confusion\\nand disorder of the sixth and seventh centuries of the Christian era.': 564, 'The dissemination and triumph of such ideas\\nmust be the work of a multitude of devoted and undistinguished missionaries, and no contemporary writer can\\npresume to guess how far such work has gone or what harvest it may be preparing.': 557, 'Social and economic questions seem to be inseparably mingled with international ones.': 95, 'The solution in each case\\nlies in an appeal to that same spirit of service which can enter and inspire the human heart.': 261, 'The distrust,\\nintractability and egotism of nations reflects and is reflected by the distrust, intractability and egotism of the\\nindividual owner and worker in the face of the common good.': 188, 'Exaggerations of possessiveness in the individual\\nare parallel and of a piece with the clutching greed of nations and emperors.': 97, 'They are products of the same\\ninstinctive tendencies, and

850, 'The Expansion of the United States\\nTHE REGION of the world that displayed the most immediate and striking results from the new inventions in\\ntransport was North America.': 803, 'Politically the United States embodied, and its constitution crystallized, the liberal\\nideas of the middle eighteenth century.': 362, 'It dispensed with statechurch or crown, it would have no titles, it\\nprotected property very jealously as a method of freedom, andthe exact practice varied at first in the different\\nstatesit gave nearly every adult male citizen a vote.': 781, 'Its method of voting was barbarically crude, and as a\\nconsequence its political life fell very soon under the control of highly organized party machines, but that did not\\nprevent the newly emancipated population developing an energy, enterprise and public spirit far beyond that of\\nany other contemporary population.': 859, 'Then came that acceleration of locomotion to which we have already called attention.': 300, 'It is a curious thing that\\nAmerica, which owes most to this acceleration in locomotion, has felt it least.': 93, 'The United States have taken the\\nrailway, the river steamboat, the telegraph and so forth as though they were a natural part of their growth.': 251, 'These things happened to come along just in time to save American unity.': 384, 'The United States of today\\nwere made first by the river steamboat, and then by the railway.': 552, 'Without these things, the present United States,\\nthis vast continental nation, would have been altogether impossible.': 395, 'The westward flow of population would have\\nbeen far more sluggish.': 366, 'It might never have crossed the great central plains.': 630, 'It took nearly two hundred years for\\neffective settlement to reach from the coast to Missouri, much less than halfway across the continent.': 691, 'The first\\nstate established beyond the river was the steamboat state of Missouri in 1821.': 519, 'But the rest of the distance to the\\nPacific was done in a few decades.': 67, 'If we had the resources of the cinema it would be interesting to show a map of North America year by year from\\n1600 onward, with little dots to represent hundreds of people, each dot a hundred, and stars to represent cities of a\\nhundred thousand people.': 1136, 'For two hundred years the reader would see that stippling creeping slowly along the coastal districts and\\nnavigable waters, spreading still more gradually into Indiana, Kentucky and so forth.': 816, 'Then somewhere about 1810\\nwould come a change.': 266, 'Things would get more lively along the river courses.': 244, 'The dots would be multiplying and\\nspreading.': 204, 'That would be the steamboat.': 185, 'The pioneer dots would be spreading soon over Kansas and Nebraska\\nfrom a number of jumpingoff places along the great rivers.': 758, 'Then from about 1830 onward would come the black lines of the railways, and after that the little black dots\\nwould not simply creep but run.': 646, 'They would appear now so rapidly, it would be almost as though they were being\\nput on by some sort of spraying machine.': 560, 'And suddenly here and then there would appear the first stars to indicate\\nthe first great cities of a hundred thousand people.': 1602, 'First one or two and then a multitude of citieseach like a knot\\nin the growing net of the railways.A Short History of the World.': 543, 'The Expansion of the United States 121The growth of the United States is a process that has no precedent in the worlds history it is a new kind of\\noccurrence.': 640, 'Such a community could not have come into existence before, and if it had, without railways it would\\ncertainly have dropped to pieces long before now.': 543, 'Without railways or telegraph it would be far easier to\\nadminister California from Pekin than from Washington.': 317, 'But this great population of the United States of\\nAmerica has not only grown outrageously it has kept uniform.': 534, 'Nay, it has become more uniform.': 42, 'The man of San\\nFrancisco is more like the man of New York today than the man of Virginia was like the man of New England a\\ncentury ago.': 1192, 'And the process of assimilation goes on unimpeded.': 45, 'The United States is being woven by railway, by\\ntelegraph, more and more into one vast unity, speaking, thinking and acting harmoniously with itself.': 366, 'Soon\\naviation will be helping in the work.': 62, 'This great community of the United States is an altogether new thing in history.': 1115, 'There have been great empires\\nbefore with populations exceeding 100 millions, but these were associations of divergent peoples there has never\\nbeen one

entirely different way.': 444, 'The United States in scale and possibility is halfway between a\\nEuropean state and a United States of all the world.': 596, 'But on the way to this present greatness and security the American people passed through one phase of dire\\nconflict.': 660, 'The river steamboats, the railways, the telegraph, and their associate facilities, did not come soon enough\\nto avert a deepening conflict of interests and ideas between the southern and northern states of the Union.': 402, 'The\\nformer were slaveholding states the latter, states in which all men were free.': 469, 'The railways and steamboats at\\nfirst did but bring into sharper conflict an already established difference between the two sections of the United\\nStates.': 546, 'The increasing unification due to the new means of transport made the question whether the southern spirit\\nor the northern should prevail an ever more urgent one.': 910, 'There was little possibility of compromise.': 116, 'The northern\\nspirit was free and individualistic the southern made for great estates and a conscious gentility ruling over a\\ndusky subject multitude.': 824, 'Every new territory that was organized into a state as the tide of population swept westward, every new\\nincorporation into the fast growing American system, became a field of conflict between the two ideas, whether it\\nshould become a state of free citizens, or whether the estate and slavery system should prevail.': 1457, 'From 1833 an\\nAmerican antislavery society was not merely resisting the extension of the institution but agitating the whole\\ncountry for its complete abolition.': 196, 'The issue flamed up into open conflict over the admission of Texas to the\\nUnion.': 53, 'Texas had originally been a part of the republic of Mexico, but it was largely colonized by Americans\\nfrom the slaveholding states, and it seceded from Mexico, established its independence in 1835, and was\\nannexed to the United States in 1844.': 297, 'Under the Mexican law slavery had been forbidden in Texas, but now the\\nSouth claimed Texas for slavery and got it.': 89, 'Meanwhile the development of ocean navigation was bringing a growing swarm of immigrants from Europe to\\nswell the spreading population of the northern states, and the raising of Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Oregon,\\nall northern farm lands, to state level, gave the antislavery North the possibility of predominance both in the\\nSenate and the House of Representatives.': 551, 'The cottongrowing South, irritated by the growing threat of the\\nAbolitionist movement, and fearing this predominance in Congress, began to talk of secession from the Union.': 159, 'Southerners began to dream of annexations to the south of them in Mexico and the West Indies, and of a great\\nslave state, detached from the North and reaching to Panama.': 724, 'The return of Abraham Lincoln as an antiextension President in 1860 decided the South to split the Union.': 26, 'South\\nCarolina passed an ordinance of secession, and prepared for war.': 171, 'Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia,\\nLouisiana and Texas joined her, and a convention met at Montgomery in Alabama, elected Jefferson Davis\\npresident of the Confederated States of America, and adopted a constitution specifically upholding the\\ninstitution of negro slavery.A Short History of the World.': 77, 'The Expansion of the United States 122Abraham Lincoln was, it chanced, a man entirely typical of the new people that had grown up after the War of\\nIndependence.': 686, 'His early years had been spent as a drifting particle in the general westward flow of the population.': 370, 'He was born in Kentucky 1809, was taken to Indiana as a boy and later on to Illinois.': 89, 'Life was rough in the\\nbackwoods of Indiana in those days the house was a mere log cabin in the wilderness, and his schooling was poor\\nand casual.': 137, 'But his mother taught him to read early, and he became a voracious reader.': 254, 'At seventeen he was a big\\nathletic youth, a great wrestler and runner.': 479, 'He worked for a time as clerk in a store, went into business as a\\nstorekeeper with a drunken partner, and contracted debts that he did not fully pay off for fifteen years.': 501, 'In 1834,\\nwhen he was still only five and twenty, he was elected member of the House of Representatives for the State of\\nIllinois.': 209, 'In Illinois particularly the question of slavery flamed because the great leader of the party for the\\nextension of slavery in the national Congress was Senator Douglas of Illinois.': 586, 'Douglas was a man of great ability\\nand prestige, and for some years Lincoln fought against him by speech and pamphlet, rising steadily to the\\nposition of his most formidable and finally victorious antagonist.': 914, 'Their culminating struggle was the presidential\\ncampaign of 1860, and on the fourth of March, 1861, Lincoln was inaugurated President, with the southern states\\nalready in active secession from the rule of the federal government at Washington, and committing acts of war.': 519, 'This civil war in America was fought by improvised armies that grew steadily from a few score thousands to\\nhundreds of thousandsuntil at last the Federal forces exceeded a million men it was fought over a vast area\\nbetween New Mexico and the eastern sea, Washington and Richmond were the chief objectives.': 901, 'It is beyond our\\nscope here to tell of the mounting energy of that epic struggle that rolled to and fro across the hills and woods of\\nTennessee and Virginia and down the Mississippi.': 191, 'There was a terrible waste and killing of men.': 220, 'Thrust was\\nfollowed by counter thrust hope gave way to despondency, and returned and was again disappointed.': 197, 'Sometimes\\nWashington seemed within the Confederate grasp again the Federal armies were driving towards Richmond.': 164, 'The\\nConfederates, outnumbered and far poorer in resources, fought under a general of supreme ability, General Lee.': 213, 'The generalship of the Union was far inferior.': 111, 'Generals were dismissed, new generals appointed until at last,\\nunder Sherman and Grant, came victory over the ragged and depleted South.': 550, 'In October, 1864, a Federal army\\nunder Sherman broke through the Confederate left and marched down from Tennessee through Georgia to the\\ncoast, right across the Confederate country, and then turned up through the Carolinas, coming in upon the rear of\\nthe Confederate armies.': 637, 'Meanwhile Grant held Lee before Richmond until Sherman closed on him.': 43, 'On April 9th,\\n1865, Lee and his army surrendered at Appomattox Court House, and within a month all the remaining\\nsecessionist armies had laid down their arms and the Confederacy was at an end.': 214, 'This four years struggle had meant an enormous physical and moral strain for the people of the United States.': 529, 'The principle of state autonomy was very dear to many minds, and the North seemed in effect to be forcing\\nabolition upon the South.': 561, 'In the border states brothers and cousins, even fathers and sons, would take opposite\\nsides and find themselves in antagonistic armies.': 501, 'The North felt its cause a righteous one, but for great numbers of\\npeople it was not a fullbodied and unchallenged righteousness.': 966, 'But for Lincoln there was no doubt.': 23, 'He was a\\nclearminded man in the midst of much confusion.': 314, 'He stood for union he stood for the wide peace of America.': 115, 'He was opposed to slavery, but slavery he held to be a secondary issue his primary purpose was that the United\\nStates should not be torn into two contrasted and jarring fragments.': 227, 'When in the opening stages of the war Congress and the Federal generals embarked upon a precipitate\\nemancipation, Lincoln opposed and mitigated their enthusiasm.': 488, 'He was for emancipation by stages and with\\ncompensation.': 8, 'It was only in January, 1865, that the situation had ripened to a point when Congress could propose\\nto abolish slavery for ever by a constitutional amendment, and the war was already over before this amendment\\nwas ratified by the states.': 494, 'As the war dragged on through 1862 and 1863, the first passions and enthusiasms waned, and America learnt all\\nthe phases of war weariness and war disgust.': 730, 'The President found himself with defeatists, traitors, dismissed\\ngenerals, tortuous party

held the United States together through long weary months of reverses and ineffective effort, through black\\nphases of division and failing courage and there is no record that he ever faltered from his purpose.': 348, 'There were\\ntimes when there was nothing to be done, when he sat in the White House silent and motionless, a grim\\nmonument of resolve times when he relaxed his mind by jesting and broad anecdotes.': 191, 'He saw the Union triumphant.': 26, 'He entered Richmond the day after its surrender, and heard of Lees capitulation.': 47, 'He returned to Washington, and on April 11th

was under the sway of a fantastic religious\\nimpostor, Rasputin, and the public administration, civil and military, was in a state of extreme inefficiency and\\ncorruption.': 597, 'At the outset of the war there was a great flare of patriotic enthusiasm in Russia.': 608, 'A vast conscript\\narmy was called up, for which there was neither adequate military equipment nor a proper supply of competent\\nofficers, and this great host, ill supplied and badly handled, was hurled against the German and Austrian frontiers.': 707, 'There can be no doubt that the early appearance of Russian armies in East Prussia in September, 1914, diverted\\nthe energies and attention of the Germans from their first victorious drive upon Paris.': 745, 'The sufferings and deaths of\\nscores of thousands of illled Russian peasants saved France from complete overthrow in that momentous\\nopening campaign, and made all western Europe the debtors of that great and tragic people.': 1030, 'But the strain of the\\nwar upon this sprawling, illorganized empire was too heavy for its strength.': 667, 'The Russian common soldiers were\\nsent into battle without guns to support them, without even rifle ammunition they were wasted by their officers\\nand generals in a delirium of militarist enthusiasm.': 386, 'For a time they seemed to be suffering mutely as the beasts\\nsuffer but there is a limit to the endurance even of the most ignorant.': 371, 'A profound disgust for Tsardom was\\ncreeping through these armies of betrayed and wasted men.': 280, 'From the close of 1915 onward Russia was a source\\nof deepening anxiety to her Western Allies.': 64, 'Throughout 1916 she remained largely on defensive, and there were\\nrumours of a separate peace with Germany.': 167, 'On December 29th, 1916, the monk Rasputin was murdered at a dinner party in Petrograd, and a belated attempt\\nwas made to put the Tsardom in order.': 291, 'By March things were moving rapidly food riots in Petrograd developed\\ninto a revolutionary insurrection there was an attempted suppression of the Duma, the representative body, there\\nwere attempted arrests of liberal leaders, the formation of a provisional government under Prince Lvoff, and an\\nabdication March 15th by the Tsar.': 293, 'For a time it seemed that a moderate and controlled revolution might be\\npossibleperhaps under a new Tsar.': 595, 'Then it became evident that the destruction of popular confidence in Russia\\nhad gone too far for any such adjustments.': 282, 'The Russian people were sick to death of the old order of things in\\nEurope, of Tsars and wars and of Great Powers it wanted relief, and that speedily, from unendurable miseries.': 515, 'The Allies had no understanding of Russian realities their diplomatists were ignorant of Russian, genteel persons\\nwith their attention directed to the Russian Court rather than to Russia, they blundered steadily with the new\\nsituation.': 382, 'There was little goodwill among these diplomatists for republicanism, and a manifest disposition toA Short History of the World.': 196, 'The Revolution and Famine in Russia 132embarrass the new government as much as possible.': 494, 'At the head of the Russian republican government was an\\neloquent and picturesque leader, Kerensky, who found himself assailed by the forces of a profounder\\nrevolutionary movement, the social revolution, at home and coldshouldered by the Allied governments abroad.': 441, 'His Allies would neither let him give the Russian peasants the land for which they craved nor peace beyond their\\nfrontiers.': 422, 'The French and the British press pestered their exhausted ally for a fresh offensive, but when presently\\nthe Germans made a strong attack by sea and land upon Riga, the British Admiralty quailed before the prospect of\\na Baltic expedition in relief.': 777, 'The new Russian Republic had to fight unsupported.': 278, 'In spite of their naval\\npredominance and the bitter protests of the great English admiral, Lord Fisher 18411920, it is to be noted that\\nthe British and their Allies, except for some submarine attacks, left the Germans the complete mastery of the\\nBaltic throughout the war.': 793, 'The Russian masses, however, were resolute to end the war.': 236, 'At any cost.': 4, 'There had come into existence in\\nPetrograd a body representing the workers and common soldiers, the Soviet, and this body clamoured for an\\ninternational conference of socialists at Stockholm.': 247, 'Food riots were occurring in Berlin at this time, war weariness\\nin Austria and Germany was profound, and there can be little doubt, in the light of subsequent events, that such a\\nconference would have precipitated a reasonable peace on democratic lines in 1917 and a German revolution.': 831, 'Kerensky implored his Western allies to allow this conference to take place, but, fearful of a worldwide outbreak\\nof socialism and republicanism, they refused, in spite of the favourable response of a small majority of the British\\nLabour Party.': 206, 'Without either moral or physical help from the Allies, the unhappy moderate Russian Republic\\nstill fought on and made a last desperate offensive effort in July.': 573, 'It failed after some preliminary successes, and\\nthere came another great slaughtering of Russians.': 682, 'The limit of Russian endurance was reached.': 47, 'Mutinies broke out in the Russian armies, and particularly upon the\\nnorthern front, and on November 7th, 1917, Kerenskys government was overthrown and power was seized by the\\nSoviets, dominated by the Bolshevik socialists under Lenin, and pledged to make peace regardless of the Western\\npowers.': 799, 'On March 2nd, 1918, a separate peace between Russia and Germany was signed at BrestLitovsk.': 81, 'It speedily became evident that these Bolshevik socialists were men of a very different quality from the rhetorical\\nconstitutionalists and revolutionaries of the Kerensky phase.': 419, 'They were fanatical Marxist communists.': 4, 'They\\nbelieved that their accession to power in Russia was only the opening of a worldwide social revolution, and they\\nset about changing the social and economic order with the thoroughness of perfect faith and absolute\\ninexperience.': 562, 'The western European and the American governments were themselves much too illinformed and\\nincapable to guide or help this extraordinary experiment, and the press set itself to discredit and the ruling classes\\nto wreck these usurpers upon any terms and at any cost to themselves or to Russia.': 676, 'A propaganda of abominable\\nand disgusting inventions went on unchecked in the press of the world the Bolshevik leaders were represented as\\nincredible monsters glutted with blood and plunder and living lives of sensuality before which the realities of the\\nTsarist court during the Rasputin regime paled to a white purity.': 768, 'Expeditions were launched at the exhausted\\ncountry, insurgents and raiders were encouraged, armed and subsidized, and no method of attack was too mean or\\ntoo monstrous for the frightened enemies of the Bolshevik regime.': 152, 'In 1919, the Russian Bolsheviks, ruling a\\ncountry already exhausted and disorganized by five years of intensive warfare, were fighting a British Expedition\\nat Archangel, Japanese invaders in Eastern Siberia, Roumanians with French and Greek contingents in the south,\\nthe Russian Admiral Koltchak in Siberia and General Deniken, supported by the French fleet, in the Crimea.': 497, 'In\\nJuly of that year an Esthonian army, under General Yudenitch, almost got to Petersburg.': 133, 'In 1920 the Poles, incited\\nby the French, made a new attack on Russia and a new reactionary raider, General Wrangel, took over the task of\\nGeneral Deniken in invading and devastating his own country.': 846, 'In March, 1921, the sailors at Cronstadt revolted.': 15, 'The Russian Government under its president, Lenin, survived all these various attacks.': 70, 'It showed an amazing\\ntenacity, and the common people of Russia sustained it unswervingly under conditions of extreme hardship.': 406, 'By\\nthe end of 1921 both Britain and Italy had made a sort of recognition of the communist rule.': 354, 'But if the Bolshevik Government was successful in its struggle against foreign intervention and internal revolt, it\\nwas far less happy in its attempts to set up a new social order based upon communist ideas in Russia.': 1094, 'The Revolution and Famine in Russia 133peasant is a small landhungry proprietor, as far from communism in his thoughts and methods as a whale is from\\nflying the revolution gave him the land of the great landowners but could not make him grow food for anything\\nbut negotiable money, and the revolution, among other things, had practically destroyed the value of money.': 1310, 'Agricultural production, already greatly disordered by the collapse of the railways through warstrain, shrank to a\\nmere cultivation of food by the peasants for their own consumption.': 186, 'The towns starved.': 13, 'Hasty and illplanned\\nattempts to make over industrial production in accordance with communist ideas were equally unsuccessful.': 191, 'By\\n1920 Russia presented the unprecedented spectacle of a modern civilization in complete collapse.': 141, 'Railways were\\nrusting and passing out of use, towns were falling into ruin, everywhere there was an immense mortality.': 93, 'Yet the\\ncountry still fought with its enemies at its gates.': 260, 'In 1921 came a drought and a great famine among the peasant\\ncultivators in the wardevastated southeast provinces.': 707, 'Millions of people starved.': 236, 'But the question of the distresses and the possible recuperation of Russia brings us too close to current\\ncontroversies to be discussed here.': 142, 'The Political and Social Reconstruction of the World\\nTHE SCHEME and scale upon which this History is planned do not permit us to enter into the complicated and\\nacrimonious disputes that centre about the treaties, and particularly of the treaty of Versailles, which concluded\\nthe Great War.': 450, 'We are beginning to realize that that conflict, terrible and enormous as it was, ended nothing,\\nbegan nothing and settled nothing.': 306, 'It killed millions of people it wasted and impoverished the world.': 763, 'It smashed\\nRussia altogether.': 51, 'It was at best an acute and frightful reminder that we were living foolishly and confusedly\\nwithout much plan or foresight in a dangerous and unsympathetic universe.': 280, 'The crudely organized egotisms and\\npassions of national and imperial greed that carried mankind into that tragedy, emerged from it sufficiently\\nunimpaired to make some other similar disaster highly probable so soon as the world has a little recovered from\\nits war exhaustion and fatigue.': 1026, 'Wars and revolutions make nothing their utmost service to mankind is that, in a\\nvery rough and painful way, they destroy superannuated and obstructive things.': 329, 'The great war lifted the threat of\\nGerman imperialism from Europe, and shattered the imperialism of Russia.': 604, 'It cleared away a number of\\nmonarchies.': 83, 'But a multitude of flags still waves in Europe, the frontiers still exasperate, great armies accumulate\\nfresh stores of equipment.': 879, 'The Peace Conference at Versailles was a gathering very ill adapted to do more than carry out the conflicts and\\ndefeats of the war to their logical conclusions.': 187, 'The Germans, Austrians, Turks and Bulgarians were permitted no\\nshare in its deliberations they were only to accept the decisions it dictated to them.': 34, 'From the point of view of\\nhuman welfare the choice of the place of meeting was particularly unfortunate.': 230, 'It was at Versailles in 1871 that,\\nwith every circumstance of triumphant vulgarity, the new German Empire had been proclaimed.': 338, 'The suggestion\\nof a melodramatic reversal of that scene, in the same Hall of Mirrors, was overpowering.': 19, 'Whatever generosities had appeared in the opening phases of the Great War had long been exhausted.': 148, 'The\\npopulations of the victorious countries were acutely aware of their own losses and sufferings, and entirely\\nregardless of the fact that the defeated had paid in the like manner.': 287, 'The war had arisen as a natural and inevitable\\nconsequence of the competitive nationalisms of Europe and the absence of any Federal adjustment of these\\ncompetitive forces war is the necessary logical consummation of independent sovereign nationalities living in too\\nsmall an area with too powerful an armament and if the great war had not come in the form it did it would have\\ncome in some similar formjust as it will certainly return upon a still more disastrous scale in twenty or thirty\\nyears time if no political unification anticipates and prevents it.': 2476, 'States organized for war will make wars as surely\\nas hens will lay eggs, but the feeling of these distressed and warworn countries disregarded this fact, and the\\nwhole of the defeated peoples were treated as morally and materially responsible for all the damage, as they\\nwould no doubt have treated the victor peoples had the issue of war been different.': 1060, 'The French and English\\nthought the Germans were to blame, the Germans thought the Russians, French and English were to blame, and\\nonly an intelligent minority thought that there was anything to blame in the fragmentary political constitution ofA Short History of the World.': 309, 'The treaty of Versailles was intended to be exemplary and vindictive it provided tremendous penalties\\nfor the vanquished it sought to provide compensations for the wounded and suffering victors by imposing\\nenormous debts upon nations already bankrupt, and its attempts to reconstitute international relations by the\\nestablishment of a League of Nations against war were manifestly insincere and inadequate.': 669, 'So far as Europe was concerned it is doubtful if there would have been any attempt whatever to organize\\ninternational relations for a permanent peace.': 425, 'The proposal of the League of Nations was brought into practical\\npolitics by the President of the United States of America, President Wilson.': 72, 'Its chief support was in America.': 52, 'So\\nfar the United States, this new modern state, had developed no distinctive ideas of international relationship\\nbeyond the Monroe Doctrine, which protected the new world from European interference.': 1416, 'Now suddenly it was\\ncalled upon for its mental contribution to the vast problem of the time.': 630, 'It had none.': 9, 'The natural disposition of the\\nAmerican people was towards a permanent world peace.': 858, 'With this however was linked a strong traditional distrust\\nof oldworld politics and a habit of isolation from oldworld entanglements.': 85, 'The Americans had hardly begun to\\nthink out an American solution of world problems when the submarine campaign of the Germans dragged them\\ninto the war on the side of the antiGerman allies.': 719, 'President Wilsons scheme of a League of Nations was an\\nattempt at short notice to create a distinctively American world project.': 643, 'It was a sketchy, inadequate and\\ndangerous scheme.': 20, 'In Europe however it was taken as a matured American point of view.': 72, 'The generality of\\nmankind in 191819 was intensely weary of war and anxious at almost any sacrifice to erect barriers against its\\nrecurrence, but there was not a single government in the old world willing to waive one iota of its sovereign\\nindependence to attain any such end.': 1218, 'The public utterances of President Wilson leading up to the project of a\\nWorld League of Nations seemed for a time to appeal right over the heads of the governments to the peoples of\\nthe world they were taken as expressing the ripe intentions of America, and the response was enormous.': 970, 'Unhappily President Wilson had to deal with governments and not with peoples he was a man capable of\\ntremendous flashes of vision and yet when put to the test egotistical and limited, and the great wave of enthusiasm\\nhe evoked passed and was wasted.': 893, 'Says Dr. Dillon in his book, The Peace Conference Europe, when the President touched its shores, was as clay\\nready for the creative potter.': 45, 'Never before were the nations so eager to follow a Moses who would take them to\\nthe longpromised land where wars are prohibited and blockades unknown.': 352, 'And to their thinking he was just that\\ngreat leader.': 470, 'In France men bowed down before him with awe and affection.': 202, 'Labour leaders in Paris told me that\\nthey shed tears of joy in his presence, and that their comrades would go through fire and water to help him to\\nrealize his noble schemes.': 350, 'To the working classes in Italy his name was a heavenly clarion at the sound of which\\nthe earth would be renewed.': 295, 'The Germans regarded him and his doctrine as their sheetanchor of safety.': 30, 'The\\nfearless Herr Muehlon said If President Wilson were to address the Germans, and pronounce a severe sentence\\nupon them, they would accept it with resignation and without a murmur and set to work at once.': 690, 'In\\nGermanAustria his fame was that of a saviour, and the mere mention of his name brought balm to the suffering\\nand surcease of sorrow to the afflicted.': 108, 'Such were the overpowering expectations that President Wilson raised.': 12, 'How completely he disappointed them\\nand how weak and futile was the League of Nations he made is too long and too distressful a story to tell here.': 379, 'He\\nexaggerated in his person our common human tragedy, he was so very great in his dreams and so incapable in his\\nperformance.': 698, 'America dissented from the acts of its President and would not join the League Europe accepted\\nfrom him.': 195, 'There was a slow realization on the part of the American people that it had been rushed into something\\nfor which it was totally unprepared.': 354, 'There was a corresponding realization on the part of Europe that America had\\nnothing ready to give to the old world in its extremity.': 695, 'Born prematurely and crippled at its birth, that League has\\nbecome indeed, with its elaborate and unpractical constitution and its manifest limitations of power, a serious\\nobstacle in the way of any effective reorganization of international relationships.': 358, 'The problem would be a clearer\\none if the League did not yet exist.': 483, 'Yet that worldwide blaze of enthusiasm that first welcomed the project, that\\nreadiness of men everywhere round and about the earth, of men, that is, as distinguished from governments, for a\\nworld control of war, is a thing to be recorded with emphasis in any history.': 1825, 'Behind the shortsighted\\ngovernments that divide and mismanage human affairs, a real force for world unity and world order exists andA Short History of the World.': 1252, 'The Political and Social Reconstruction of the World 135': 1}\n"

it was believed and taught that the world\\nhad been created suddenly in 4004 B.C., though authorities differed as to whether this had occurred in the spring\\nor autumn of that year.', 'This fantastically precise misconception was based upon a too literal interpretation of the\\nHebrew Bible, and upon rather arbitrary theological assumptions connected therewith.', 'Such ideas have long since\\nbeen abandoned by religious teachers, and it is universally recognized that the universe in which we live has to all\\nappearances existed for an enormous period of time and possibly for endless time.', 'Of course there may be\\ndeception in these appearances, as a room may be made to seem endless by putting mirrors facing each other at\\neither end.', 'But that the universe in which we live has existed only for six or seven thousand years may be\\nregarded as an altogether exploded idea.', 'The earth, as everybody knows nowadays, is a spheroid, a sphere slightly compressed, orange fashion, with a\\ndiameter of nearly 8,000 miles.', 'Its spherical shape has been known at least to a limited number of intelligent\\npeople for nearly 2,500 years, but before that time it was

about 24 miles shorter than its equatorial diameter every twentyfour hours, and that this\\nis the cause of the alternations of day and night, that it circles about the sun in a slightly distorted and slowly\\nvariable oval path in a year.', 'Its distance from the sun varies between ninetyone and a half millions at its nearest\\nand ninetyfour and a half million miles.', 'About the earth circles a

because all the water there was would still be\\nsuperheated steam in a stormy atmosphere of sulphurous and metallic vapours.', 'Beneath this would swirl and boil\\nan ocean of molten rock substance.', 'Across a sky of fiery clouds the glare of the hurrying sun and moon would\\nsweep swiftly like hot breaths of flame.', 'Slowly by degrees as one million of years followed another, this fiery scene would lose its eruptive\\nincandescence.', 'The vapours in the sky would rain down and become less dense overhead great slaggy cakes of\\nsolidifying rock would appear upon the surface of the molten sea, and sink under it, to be replaced by other\\nfloating masses.', 'The sun and moon growing now each more distant and each smaller, would rush with\\ndiminishing swiftness across the heavens.', 'The moon now, because of its smaller size, would be already cooled far\\nbelow incandescence, and would be alternately obstructing and reflecting the sunlight in a series of eclipses and\\nfull moons.', 'And so with a tremendous slowness through the vastness of time, the earth would grow more and more like the\\nearth on which we live, until at last an age would come when, in the cooling air, steam would begin to condense\\ninto clouds, and the first rain would fall hissing upon the first rocks below.', 'For endless millenia the greater part of\\nthe earths water would still be vaporized in the atmosphere, but there would now be hot streams running over the\\ncrystallizing rocks below and pools and lakes into which these streams would be carrying detritus and depositing\\nsediment.', 'At last a condition of things must have been attained in which a man might have stood up on earth and looked\\nabout him and lived.', 'If we could have visited the earth at that time we should have stood on great lavalike\\nmasses of rock without a trace of soil or touch of living vegetation, under a stormrent sky.', 'Hot and violent\\nwinds, exceeding the fiercest tornado that ever blows, and downpours of rain such as our milder, slower earth\\ntoday knows nothing of, might have assailed us.', 'The water of the downpour would have rushed by us, muddy\\nwith the spoils of the rocks, coming together into torrents, cutting deep gorges and canyons as they hurried past to\\ndeposit their sediment in the earliest seas.', 'Through the clouds we should have glimpsed a great sun moving\\nvisibly across the sky, and in its wake and in the wake of the moon would have come a diurnal tide of earthquake\\nand upheaval.', 'And the moon, which nowadays keeps one constant face to earth, would then have been rotating\\nvisibly and showing the side it now hides so inexorably.', 'The earth aged.', 'One million years followed another, and the day lengthened, the sun grew more distant and\\nmilder, the moons pace in the sky slackened the intensity of rain and storm diminished and the water in the first\\nseas increased and ran together into the ocean garment our planet henceforth wore.', 'But there was no life as yet upon the earth the seas were lifeless, and the rocks were barren.', 'III.', 'The Beginnings of Life\\nAS everybody knows nowadays, the knowledge we

astir are\\nvestiges of comparatively simple and lowly things the shells of small shellfish, the stems and flowerlike heads of\\nzoophytes, seaweeds and the tracks and remains of sea worms and crustacea.', 'Very early appear certain creatures\\nrather like plantlice, crawling creatures which could roll themselves up into balls as the plantlice do, the\\ntrilobites.', 'Later by a few million years or so come certain sea scorpions, more mobile and powerful creatures than\\nthe world had ever seen before.', 'None of these creatures were of very great size.', 'Among the largest were certain of the sea scorpions, which\\nmeasured nine feet in length.', 'There are no signs whatever of land life of any sort, plant or animal there are no\\nfishes nor any vertebrated creatures in this part of the record.', 'Essentially all the plants and creatures which have\\nleft us their traces from this period of the earths history are shallowwater and intertidal beings.', 'If we wished to\\nparallel the flora and fauna of the Lower Palaeozoic rocks on the earth today, we should do it best, except in the\\nmatter of size, by taking a drop of water from a rock pool or scummy ditch and examining it under a microscope.', 'The little crustacea, the small shellfish, the zoophytes and algae we should find there would display a quite\\nstriking resemblance to these clumsier, larger prototypes that once were the crown of life upon our planet.', 'It is well, however, to bear in mind that the Lower Palaeozoic rocks probably do not give us anything at all\\nrepresentative of the first beginnings of life on our planet.', 'Unless a creature has bones or other hard parts, unless\\nit wears a shell or is big enough and heavy enough to make characteristic footprints and trails in mud, it is\\nunlikely to leave any fossilized traces of its existence behind.', 'Today there are hundreds of thousands of species\\nof small softbodied creatures in our world which it is inconceivable can ever leave any mark for future geologists\\nto discover.', 'In the worlds past, millions of millions of species of such creatures may have lived and multiplied\\nand flourished and passed away without a trace remaining.', 'The waters of the warm and shallow lakes and seas of\\nthe socalled Azoic period may have teemed with an infinite variety of lowly, jellylike, shellless and boneless\\ncreatures, and a multitude of green scummy plants may have spread over the sunlit intertidal rocks and beaches.', 'The Record of the Rocks is no more a complete record of life in the past than the books of a bank are a record of\\nthe existence of everybody in the neighbourhood.', 'It is only when a species begins to secrete a shell or a spicule or\\na carapace or a limesupported stem, and so put by something for the future, that it goes upon the Record.', 'But in\\nrocks of an age prior to those which bear any fossil traces, graphite, a form of uncombined carbon, is sometimes\\nfound, and some

its offspring, and there is an individual difference between every parent and every offspring it\\nproduces, and this is true in every species and at every stage of life.', 'Now scientific men are not able to explain to us either why offspring should resemble nor why they should differ\\nfrom their parents.', 'But seeing that offspring do at once resemble and differ, it is a matter rather of common sense\\nthan of scientific knowledge that, if the conditions under which a species live are changed, the species should\\nundergo some correlated changes.', 'Because in any generation of the species there must be a number of individuals\\nwhose individual differences make them better adapted to the new conditions under which the species has to live,\\nand a number whose individual differences make it rather harder for them to live.', 'And on the whole the former\\nsort will live longer, bear more offspring, and reproduce themselves more abundantly than the latter, and so\\ngeneration by generation the average of the species will change in the favourable direction.', 'This process, which is\\ncalled Natural Selection, is not so much a scientific theory as a necessary deduction from the facts of reproduction\\nand individual difference.', 'There may be many forces at work varying, destroying and preserving species, about\\nwhich science may still be unaware or undecided, but the man who can deny the operation of this process of\\nnatural selection upon life since its beginning must be either ignorant of the elementary facts of life or incapable\\nof ordinary thought.', 'Many scientific men have speculated about the first beginning of life and their speculations are often of great\\ninterest, but there is absolutely no definite knowledge and no convincing guess yet of the way in which life began.', 'But nearly all authorities are agreed that it probably began upon mud or sand in warm sunlit shallow brackish\\nwater, and that it spread up the beaches to the intertidal lines and out to the open waters.', 'That early world was a world of strong tides and currents.', 'An incessant destruction of individuals must have been\\ngoing on through their being swept up the

for\\nmutual understanding has arisen, the advantages of continuing the association are very great and we presently\\nfind a number of mammalian species displaying the beginnings of a true social life

asA Short History of the World.': 346, 'The Beginnings of Life 41,600,000,000 years.': 162, 'The earliest rocks in the record are called by geologists the Azoic rocks, because they show no traces of life.': 443, 'Great areas of these Azoic rocks lie uncovered in North America, and they are of such a thickness that geologists\\nconsider that they represent a period of at least half of the 1,600,000,000 which they assign to the whole\\ngeological record.': 296, 'Let me repeat this profoundly significant fact.': 43, 'Half the great interval of time since land and sea\\nwere first distinguishable on earth has left us no traces of life.': 1472, 'There are ripplings and rain marks still to be found\\nin these rocks, but no marks nor vestiges of any living thing.': 414, 'Then, as we come up the record, signs of past life appear and increase.': 394, 'The age of the worlds history in which we\\nfind these past traces is called by geologists the Lower Palaeozoic age.': 713, 'The first indications that life was astir are\\nvestiges of comparatively simple and lowly things the shells of small shellfish, the stems and flowerlike heads of\\nzoophytes, seaweeds and the tracks and remains of sea worms and crustacea.': 798, 'Very early appear certain creatures\\nrather like plantlice, crawling creatures which could roll themselves up into balls as the plantlice do, the\\ntrilobites.': 456, 'Later by a few million years or so come certain sea scorpions, more mobile and powerful creatures than\\nthe world had ever seen before.': 933, 'None of these creatures were of very great size.': 498, 'Among the largest were certain of the sea scorpions, which\\nmeasured nine feet in length.': 159, 'There are no signs whatever of land life of any sort, plant or animal there are no\\nfishes nor any vertebrated creatures in this part of the record.': 568, 'Essentially all the plants and creatures which have\\nleft us their traces from this period of the earths history are shallowwater and intertidal beings.': 530, 'If we wished to\\nparallel the flora and fauna of the Lower Palaeozoic rocks on the earth today, we should do it best, except in the\\nmatter of size, by taking a drop of water from a rock pool or scummy ditch and examining it under a microscope.': 317, 'The little crustacea, the small shellfish, the zoophytes and algae we should find there would display a quite\\nstriking resemblance to these clumsier, larger prototypes that once were the crown of life upon our planet.': 1020, 'It is well, however, to bear in mind that the Lower Palaeozoic rocks probably do not give us anything at all\\nrepresentative of the first beginnings of life on our planet.': 798, 'Unless a creature has bones or other hard parts, unless\\nit wears a shell or is big enough and heavy enough to make characteristic footprints and trails in mud, it is\\nunlikely to leave any fossilized traces of its existence behind.': 262, 'Today there are hundreds of thousands of species\\nof small softbodied creatures in our world which it is inconceivable can ever leave any mark for future geologists\\nto discover.': 686, 'In the worlds past, millions of millions of species of such creatures may have lived and multiplied\\nand flourished and passed away without a trace remaining.': 409, 'The waters of the warm and shallow lakes and seas of\\nthe socalled Azoic period may have teemed with an infinite variety of lowly, jellylike, shellless and boneless\\ncreatures, and a multitude of green scummy plants may have spread over the sunlit intertidal rocks and beaches.': 529, 'The Record of the Rocks is no more a complete record of life in the past than the books of a bank are a record of\\nthe existence of everybody in the neighbourhood.': 424, 'It is only when a species begins to secrete a shell or a spicule or\\na carapace or a limesupported stem, and so put by something for the future, that it goes upon the Record.': 395, 'But in\\nrocks of an age prior to those which bear any fossil traces, graphite, a form of uncombined carbon, is sometimes\\nfound, and some authorities consider that it may have been separated out from combination through the vital\\nactivities of unknown living things.': 584, 'The Age of Fishes\\nIN the days when the world was supposed to have endured for only a few thousand years, it was

and study the Record of the Rocks this belief gave place to\\nthe suspicion that many species had changed and developed slowly through the course of ages, and this again\\nexpanded into a belief in what is called Organic Evolution, a belief that all species of life upon earth, animal and\\nvegetable alike, are descended by slow continuous processes of change from some very simple ancestral form ofA Short History of the World.': 1404, 'The Age of Fishes 5life, some almost structureless living substance, far back in the socalled Azoic seas.': 280, 'This question of Organic Evolution, like the question of the age of the earth, has in the past been the subject of\\nmuch bitter controversy.': 529, 'There was a time when a belief in organic evolution was for rather obscure reasons\\nsupposed to be incompatible with sound Christian, Jewish and Moslem doctrine.': 321, 'That time has passed, and the\\nmen of the most orthodox Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Mohammedan belief are now free to accept this newer\\nand broader view of a common origin of all living things.': 714, 'No life seems to have happened suddenly upon earth.': 615, 'Life grew and grows.': 48, 'Age by age through gulfs of time at which imagination reels, life has been growing from a\\nmere stirring in the intertidal slime towards freedom, power and consciousness.': 829, 'Life consists of individuals.': 9, 'These individuals are definite things, they are not like the lumps and masses, nor even\\nthe limitless and motionless crystals, of nonliving matter, and they have two characteristics no dead matter\\npossesses.': 521, 'They can assimilate other matter into themselves and make it part of themselves, and they can\\nreproduce themselves.': 157, 'They eat and they breed.': 9, 'They can give rise to other individuals, for the most part like\\nthemselves, but always also a little different from themselves.': 499, 'There is a specific and family resemblance between\\nan individual and its offspring, and there is an individual difference between every parent and every offspring it\\nproduces, and this is true in every species and at every stage of life.': 638, 'Now scientific men are not able to explain to us either why offspring should resemble nor why they should differ\\nfrom their parents.': 350, 'But seeing that offspring do at once resemble and differ, it is a matter rather of common sense\\nthan of scientific knowledge that, if the conditions under which a species live are changed, the species should\\nundergo some correlated changes.': 432, 'Because in any generation of the species there must be a number of individuals\\nwhose individual differences make them better adapted to the new conditions under which the species has to live,\\nand a number whose individual differences make it rather harder for them to live.': 841, 'And on the whole the former\\nsort will live longer, bear more offspring, and reproduce themselves more abundantly than the latter, and so\\ngeneration by generation the average of the species will change in the favourable direction.': 299, 'This process, which is\\ncalled Natural Selection, is not so much a scientific theory as a necessary deduction from the facts of reproduction\\nand individual difference.': 309, 'There may be many forces at work varying, destroying and preserving species, about\\nwhich science may still be unaware or undecided, but the man who can deny the operation of this process of\\nnatural selection upon life since its beginning must be either ignorant of the elementary facts of life or incapable\\nof ordinary thought.': 1824, 'Many scientific men have speculated about the first beginning of life and their speculations are often of great\\ninterest, but there is absolutely no definite knowledge and no convincing guess yet of the way in which life began.': 1731, 'But nearly all authorities are agreed that it probably began upon mud or sand in warm sunlit shallow brackish\\nwater, and that it spread up the beaches to the intertidal lines and out to the open waters.': 626, 'That early world was a world of strong tides and currents.': 1045, 'An incessant destruction of individuals must have been\\ngoing on through their being swept up the beaches and dried, or by their being swept out to sea and sinking down\\nout of reach of air and sun.': 282, 'Early conditions favoured the development of every tendency to root and hold on,\\nevery tendency to form an outer skin and casing to protect the stranded individual from immediate desiccation.': 359, 'From the very earliest any tendency to sensitiveness to taste would turn the individual in the direction of food, and\\nany sensitiveness to light would assist it to struggle back out of the darkness of the sea deeps and caverns or to\\nwriggle back out of the excessive glare of the dangerous shallows.': 741, 'Probably the first shells and body armour of living things were protections against drying rather than against\\nactive enemies.': 476, 'But tooth and claw come early into our earthly history.': 418, 'We have already noted the size of the earlier water scorpions.': 167, 'For long ages such creatures were the supreme\\nlords of life.': 381, 'Then in a division of these Palaeozoic rocks called the Silurian division, which many geologists now\\nsuppose to be as old as five

the Devonian system.': 221, 'They are so\\nprevalent that this period of the Record of the Rocks has been called the Age of Fishes.': 121, 'Fishes of a pattern now\\ngone from the earth, and fishes allied to the sharks and sturgeons of today, rushed through the waters, leapt in\\nthe air, browsed among the seaweeds, pursued and preyed upon one another, and gave a new liveliness to the\\nwaters of the world.': 1649, 'None of these were excessively big by our present standards.': 64, 'Few of them were more than\\ntwo or three feet long, but there were exceptional forms which were as long as twenty feet.': 397, 'We know nothing from geology of the ancestors of these fishes.': 83, 'They do not appear to be related to any of the\\nforms that preceded them.': 55, 'Zoologists have the most interesting views of their ancestry, but these they derive from\\nthe study of the development of the eggs of their still living relations, and from other sources.': 344, 'Apparently the\\nancestors of the vertebrata were softbodied and perhaps quite small swimming creatures who began first to\\ndevelop hard parts as teeth round and about their mouths.': 619, 'The teeth of a skate or dogfish cover the roof and floor\\nof its mouth and pass at the lip into the flattened toothlike scales that encase most of its body.': 67, 'As the fishes\\ndevelop these teeth scales in the geological record, they swim out of the hidden darkness of the past into the light,\\nthe first vertebrated animals visible in the record.': 506, 'V. The Age of the Coal Swamps\\nTHE LAND during this Age of Fishes was apparently quite lifeless.': 62, 'Crags and uplands of barren rock lay under\\nthe sun and rain.': 75, 'There was no real soilfor as yet there were no earthworms which help to make a soil, and no\\nplants to break up the rock particles into mould there was no trace of moss or lichen.': 210, 'Life was still only in the\\nsea.': 241, 'Over this world of barren rock played great changes of climate.': 992, 'The causes of these changes of climate were very\\ncomplex and they have still to be properly estimated.': 216, 'The changing shape of the earths orbit, the gradual shifting\\nof the poles of rotation, changes in the shapes of the continents, probably even fluctuations in the warmth of the\\nsun, now conspired to plunge great areas of the earths surface into long periods of cold and ice and now again for\\nmillions of years spread a warm or equable climate over this planet.': 1104, 'There seem to have been phases of great\\ninternal activity in the worlds history, when in the course of a few million years accumulated upthrusts would\\nbreak out in lines of volcanic eruption and upheaval and rearrange the mountain and continental outlines of the\\nglobe, increasing the depth of the sea and the height of the mountains and exaggerating the extremes of climate.': 1407, 'And these would be followed by vast ages of comparative quiescence, when frost, rain and river would wear\\ndown the mountain heights and carry great masses of silt to fill and raise the sea bottoms and spread the seas, ever\\nshallower and wider, over more and more of the land.': 1280, 'There have been high and deep ages in the worlds history\\nand low and level ages.': 414, 'The reader must dismiss from his mind any idea that the surface of the earth has been\\ngrowing steadily cooler since its crust grew solid.': 365, 'After that much cooling had been achieved, the internal\\ntemperature ceased to affect surface conditions.': 230, 'There are traces of periods of superabundant ice and snow, of\\nGlacial Ages, that is, even in the Azoic period.': 202, 'It was only towards the close of the Age of Fishes, in a period of extensive shallow seas and lagoons, that life\\nspread itself out in any effectual way from the waters on to the land.': 624, 'No doubt the earlier types of the forms that\\nnow begin to appear in great abundance had already been developing in a rare and obscure manner for many\\nscores of millions of years.': 953, 'But now came their opportunity.': 165, 'Plants no doubt preceded animal forms in this invasion of the land, but the animals probably followed up the plant\\nemigration very closely.': 319, 'The first problem that the plant had to solve was the problem of some sustaining stiff\\nsupport to hold up its fronds to the sunlight when the buoyant water was withdrawn the second was the problemA Short History of the World.': 404, 'V.

development of woody tissue which both sustained the plant and\\nacted as water carrier to the leaves.': 255, 'The Record of the Rocks is suddenly crowded by a vast variety of woody\\nswamp plants, many of them of great size, big tree mosses, tree ferns, gigantic horsetails and the like.': 842, 'And with\\nthese, age by age, there crawled out of the water a great variety of animal forms.': 794, 'There were centipedes and\\nmillipedes there were the first primitive insects there were creatures related to the ancient king crabs and sea\\nscorpions which became the earliest spiders and land scorpions, and presently there were vertebrated animals.': 898, 'Some of the earlier insects were very large.': 60, 'There were dragon flies in this period with wings that spread out to\\ntwentynine inches.': 130, 'In various ways these new orders and genera had adapted themselves to breathing air.': 361, 'Hitherto all animals had\\nbreathed air dissolved in water, and that indeed is what all animals still have to do.': 319, 'But now in divers fashions the\\nanimal kingdom was acquiring the power of supplying its own moisture where it was needed.': 228, 'A man with a\\nperfectly dry lung would suffocate today his lung surfaces must be moist in order that air may pass through\\nthem into his blood.': 660, 'The adaptation to air breathing consists in all cases either in the development of a cover to\\nthe oldfashioned gills to stop evaporation, or in the development of tubes or other new breathing organs lying\\ndeep inside the body and moistened by a watery secretion.': 523, 'The old gills with which the ancestral fish of the\\nvertebrated line had breathed were inadaptable to breathing upon land, and in the case of this division of the\\nanimal kingdom it is the swimming bladder of the fish which becomes a new, deepseated breathing organ, the\\nlung.': 912, 'The kind of animals known as amphibia, the frogs and newts of today, begin their lives in the water and\\nbreathe by gills and subsequently the lung, developing in the same way as the swimming bladder of many fishes\\ndo, as a baglike outgrowth from the throat, takes over the business of breathing, the animal comes out on land,\\nand the gills dwindle and the gill slits disappear.': 564, 'All except an outgrowth of one gill slit, which becomes the\\npassage of the ear and eardrum.': 280, 'The animal can now live only in the air, but it must return at least to the edge of\\nthe water to lay its eggs and reproduce its kind.': 237, 'All the airbreathing vertebrata of this age of swamps and plants belonged to the class amphibia.': 179, 'They were\\nnearly all of them forms related to the newts of today, and some of them attained a considerable size.': 171, 'They were\\nland animals, it is true, but they were land animals needing to live in and near moist and swampy places, and all\\nthe great trees of this period were equally amphibious in their habits.': 852, 'None of them had yet developed fruits and\\nseeds of a kind that could fall on land and develop with the help only of such moisture as dew and rain could\\nbring.': 434, 'They all had to shed their spores in water, it would seem, if they were to germinate.': 262, 'It is one of the most beautiful interests of that beautiful science, comparative anatomy, to trace the complex and\\nwonderful adaptations of living things to the necessities of existence in air.': 537, 'All living things, plants and animals\\nalike, are primarily water things.': 284, 'For example all the higher vertebrated animals above the fishes, up to and\\nincluding man, pass through a stage in their development in the egg or before birth in which they have gill slits\\nwhich are obliterated before the young emerge.': 407, 'The bare, waterwashed eye of the fish is protected in the higher\\nforms from drying up by eyelids and glands which secrete moisture.': 70, 'The weaker sound vibrations of air\\nnecessitate an eardrum.': 35, 'In nearly every organ of the body similar modifications and adaptations are to be\\ndetected, similar patchingsup to meet aerial conditions.': 239, 'This Carboniferous age, this age of the amphibia, was an age of life in the swamps and lagoons and on the low\\nbanks among these waters.': 716, 'Thus far life had now extended.': 353, 'The hills and high lands were still quite barren and\\nlifeless.': 273, 'Life had learnt to breathe air indeed, but it still had its roots in its native water it still had to return to the\\nwater to reproduce its kind.A Short History of the

thick deposits of sandstones and the like, in which fossils are\\ncomparatively few.': 161, 'The temperature of the world fluctuated widely, and there were long periods of glacial cold.': 606, 'Over great areas the former profusion of swamp vegetation ceased, and, overlaid by these newer deposits, it began\\nthat process of compression and mineralization that gave the world most of the coal deposits of today.': 1196, 'But it is during periods of change that life undergoes its most rapid modifications, and under hardship that it\\nlearns its hardest lessons.': 288, 'As conditions revert towards warmth and moisture again we find a new series of animal\\nand plant forms established.': 524, 'We find in the record the remains of vertebrated animals that laid eggs which, instead\\nof hatching out tadpoles which needed to live for a time in water, carried on their development before hatching to\\na stage so nearly like the adult form that the young could live in air from the first moment of independent\\nexistence.': 1251, 'Gills had been cut out altogether, and the gill slits only appeared as an embryonic phase.': 125, 'These new creatures without a tadpole stage were the Reptiles.': 373, 'Concurrently there had been a development of\\nseedbearing trees, which could spread their seed, independently of swamp or lakes.': 241, 'There were now palmlike\\ncycads and many tropical conifers, though as yet there were no flowering plants and no grasses.': 212, 'There was a great\\nnumber of ferns.': 492, 'And there was now also an increased variety of insects.': 153, 'There were beetles, though bees and\\nbutterflies had yet to come.': 141, 'But all the fundamental forms of a new real land fauna and flora had been laid down\\nduring these vast ages of severity.': 492, 'This new land life needed only the opportunity of favourable conditions to\\nflourish and prevail.': 650, 'Age by age and with abundant fluctuations that mitigation came.': 298, 'The still incalculable movements of the earths\\ncrust, the changes in its orbit, the increase and diminution of the mutual inclination of orbit and pole, worked\\ntogether to produce a great spell of widely diffused warm conditions.': 817, 'The period lasted altogether, it is now\\nsupposed, upwards of two hundred million years.': 475, 'It is called the Mesozoic period, to distinguish it from the\\naltogether vaster Palaeozoic and Azoic periods together fourteen hundred millions that preceded it, and from the\\nCainozoic or new life period that intervened between its close and the present time, and it is also called the Age of\\nReptiles because of the astonishing predominance and variety of this form of life.': 1569, 'It came to an end some eighty\\nmillion years ago.': 430, 'In the world today the genera of Reptiles are comparatively few and their distribution is very limited.': 560, 'They are\\nmore various, it is true, than are the few surviving members of the order of the amphibia which once in the\\nCarboniferous period ruled the world.': 695, 'We still have the snakes, the turtles and tortoises the Chelonia, the\\nalligators and crocodiles, and the lizards.': 172, 'Without exception they are creatures requiring warmth all the year\\nround they cannot stand exposure to cold, and it is probable that all the reptilian beings of the Mesozoic suffered\\nunder the same limitation.': 161, 'It was a hothouse fauna, living amidst a hothouse flora.': 82, 'It endured no frosts.': 8, 'But the\\nworld had at least attained a real dry land fauna and flora as distinguished from the mud and swamp fauna and\\nflora of the previous heyday of life upon earth.': 1216, 'All the sorts of reptile we know now were much more abundantly represented then, great turtles and tortoises, big\\ncrocodiles and many lizards and snakes, but in addition there was a number of series of wonderful creatures that\\nhave now vanished altogether from the earth.': 999, 'There was a vast variety of beings called the Dinosaurs.': 132, 'Vegetation\\nwas now spreading over the lower levels of the world, reeds, brakes of fern and the like and browsing upon this\\nabundance came a multitude of herbivorous reptiles, which increased in size as the Mesozoic period rose to its\\nclimax.': 1282, 'Some of these beasts exceeded in size any other land animals that have ever lived they were as large as\\nwhales.': 244, 'The Diplodocus Carnegii for example measured eightyfour feet from snout to tail the Gigantosaurus\\nwas even greater it measured a hundred feet.': 217, 'Living upon these monsters was a swarm of carnivorous Dinosaurs\\nof a corresponding size.': 321, 'One of these, the Tyrannosaurus, is figured and described in many books as the last

jungles,\\nanother now vanished tribe of reptiles, with a batlike development of the fore limbs, pursued insects and one\\nanother, first leapt and parachuted and presently flew amidst the fronds and branches of the forest trees.': 1346, 'These were the first flying creatures with backbones they mark a new achievement in the\\ngrowing powers of vertebrated life.': 891, 'Moreover some of the reptiles were returning to the sea waters.': 116, 'Three groups of big swimming beings had\\ninvaded the sea from which their ancestors had come the Mososaurs, the Plesiosaurs, and Ichthyosaurs.': 215, 'Some of\\nthese again approached the proportions of our present whales.': 40, 'The Ichthyosaurs seem to have been quite seagoing\\ncreatures, but the Plesiosaurs were a type of animal that has no cognate form today.': 245, 'The body was stout and big\\nwith paddles, adapted either for swimming or crawling through marshes, or along the bottom of shallow waters.': 143, 'The comparatively small head was poised on a vast snake of neck, altogether outdoing the neck of the swan.': 206, 'Either the Plesiosaur swam and searched for food under the water and fed as the swan will do, or it lurked under\\nwater and snatched at passing fish or beast.': 119, 'Such was the predominant land life throughout the Mesozoic age.': 481, 'It was by our human standards an advance upon\\nanything that had preceded it.': 473, 'It had produced land animals greater in size, range, power and activity, more vital\\nas people say, than anything the world had seen before.': 1103, 'In the seas there had been no such advance but a great\\nproliferation of new forms of life.': 1000, 'An enormous variety of squidlike creatures with chambered shells, for the\\nmost part coiled, had appeared in the shallow seas, the Ammonites.': 202, 'They had had predecessors in the Palaeozoic\\nseas, but now was their age of glory.': 160, 'Today they have left no survivors at all their nearest relation is the pearly\\nNautilus, an inhabitant of tropical waters.': 75, 'And a new and more prolific type of fish with lighter, finer scales than\\nthe platelike and toothlike coverings that had hitherto prevailed, became and has since remained predominant\\nin the seas and rivers.': 564, 'The First Birds and the First Mammals\\nIN a few paragraphs a picture of the lush vegetation and swarming reptiles of that first great summer of life, the\\nMesozoic period, has been sketched.': 1052, 'But while the Dinosaurs lorded it over the hot selvas and marshy plains and\\nthe Pterodactyls filled the forests with their flutterings and possibly with shrieks and croakings as they pursued the\\nhumming insect life of the still flowerless shrubs and trees, some less conspicuous and less abundant forms upon\\nthe margins of this abounding life were acquiring certain powers and learning certain lessons of endurance, that\\nwere to be of the utmost value to their race when at last the smiling generosity of sun and earth began to fade.': 1568, 'A group of tribes and genera of hopping reptiles, small creatures of the dinosaur type, seem to have been pushed\\nby competition and the pursuit of their enemies towards the alternatives of extinction or adaptation to colder\\nconditions in the higher hills or by the sea.': 485, 'Among these distressed tribes there was developed a new type of\\nscalescales that were elongated into quilllike forms and that presently branched into the crude beginnings of\\nfeathers.': 472, 'These quilllike scales lay over one another and formed a heatretaining covering more efficient than\\nany reptilian covering that had hitherto existed.': 396, 'So they permitted an invasion of colder regions that were\\notherwise uninhabited.': 54, 'Perhaps simultaneously with these changes there arose in these creatures a greater\\nsolicitude for their eggs.': 118, 'Most reptiles are apparently quite careless about their eggs, which are left for sun and\\nseason to hatch.': 166, 'But some of the varieties upon this new branch of the tree of life were acquiring a habit of\\nguarding their eggs and keeping them warm with the warmth of their bodies.': 846, 'With these adaptations to cold other internal modifications were going on that made these creatures, the primitive\\nbirds, warmblooded and independent of basking.': 377, 'The very earliest birds seem to have been seabirds living upon\\nfish, and their fore limbs were not wings but paddles rather after the penguin type.': 512, 'That peculiarly primitive bird,A Short History of the World.': 67, 'The First Birds and the First Mammals 10the New Zealand Kiwi, has feathers of a very simple sort, and neither flies nor appears to be descended from\\nflying ancestors.': 140, 'In the development of the birds, feathers came before wings.': 249, 'But once the feather was developed\\nthe possibility of making a light spread of feathers led inevitably to the wing.': 172, 'We know of the fossil remains of\\none bird at least which had reptilian teeth in its jaw and a long reptilian tail, but which also had a true birds wing\\nand which certainly flew and held its own among the pterodactyls of the Mesozoic time.': 925, 'Nevertheless birds were\\nneither varied nor abundant in Mesozoic times.': 81, 'If a man could go back to typical Mesozoic country, he might\\nwalk for days and never see or hear such a thing as a bird, though he would see a great abundance of pterodactyls\\nand insects among the fronds and reeds.': 1432, 'And another thing he would probably never see, and that would be any sign of a mammal.': 618, 'Probably the first\\nmammals were in existence millions of years before the first thing one could call a bird, but they were altogether\\ntoo small and obscure and remote for attention.': 1313, 'The earliest mammals, like the earliest birds, were creatures driven by competition and pursuit into a life of\\nhardship and adaptation to cold.': 513, 'With them also the scale became quilllike, and was developed into a\\nheatretaining covering and they too underwent modifications, similar in kind though different in detail, to\\nbecome warmblooded and independent of basking.': 494, 'Instead of feathers they developed hairs, and instead of\\nguarding and incubating their eggs they kept them warm and safe by retaining them inside their bodies until they\\nwere almost mature.': 165, 'Most of them became altogether vivaparous and brought their young into the world alive.': 714, 'And even after their young were born they tended to maintain a protective and nutritive association with them.': 150, 'Most but not all mammals today have mammae and suckle their young.': 104, 'Two mammals still live which lay eggs\\nand which have not proper mammae, though they nourish their young by a nutritive secretion of the under skin\\nthese are the duckbilled platypus and the echidna.': 325, 'The echidna lays leathery eggs and then puts them into a\\npouch under its belly, and so carries them about warm and safe until they hatch.': 42, 'But just as a visitor to the Mesozoic world might have searched for days and weeks before finding a bird,

increasing\\nvariety of birds and mammals is entering into their inheritance.': 240, 'The Age of Mammals\\nTHE OPENING of the next great period in the life of the earth, the Cainozoic period, was a

that lie before us.': 239, 'We may be moving towards increasing sunshine or lapsing towards another\\nglacial age volcanic activity and the upheaval of mountain masses may be increasing or diminishing

obscure mammalian type, appear a number of interesting grazing animals and of\\ncarnivorous types which prey upon these.': 1598, 'At first these early mammals seem to differ only in a few characters from the great herbivorous and carnivorous\\nreptiles that ages before had flourished and then vanished from the earth.': 979, 'A careless observer might suppose that\\nin this second long age of warmth and plenty that was now beginning, nature was merely repeating the first, with\\nherbivorous and carnivorous mammals to parallel the herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs, with birds

fundamental of all these differences lies in the mental life of the two periods.': 401, 'It arises essentially out of\\nthe continuing contact of parent and offspring which distinguishes mammalian and in a lesser degree bird life,\\nfrom the life of the reptile.': 511, 'With very few exceptions the reptile abandons its egg to hatch alone.': 19, 'The young\\nreptile has no knowledge whatever of its

period.': 167, 'It was probably very like a modern rhinoceros in its habits and needs.': 248, 'But its brain\\ncapacity was not one tenth that of its living successor.': 327, 'The earlier mammals probably parted from their offspring as soon as suckling was over, but, once the capacity for\\nmutual understanding has arisen, the advantages of continuing the association are very great and we presently\\nfind a number of mammalian species displaying the beginnings of a true social life and keeping together in herds,\\npacks and flocks, watching each other, imitating each other, taking warning from each others acts and cries.': 1265, 'This\\nis something that the world had not seen before among vertebrated animals.': 630, 'Reptiles and fish may no doubt be\\nfound in swarms and

of\\nexternal forces, it is sustained by an inner impulse.': 601, 'They are not merely like one another and so found in the same\\nplaces at the same times they like one another and so they keep together.': 1062, 'This difference between the reptile world and the world of our human minds is one our sympathies seem unable to\\npass.': 1436, 'We cannot conceive in ourselves the swift uncomplicated urgency of a reptiles instinctive motives, its\\nappetites, fears and hates.': 45, 'We cannot understand them in their simplicity because all our motives are complicated\\nours are

level, after our own fashion.': 190, 'We can in consequence establish relations with almost all sorts of them.': 76, 'When they suffer they utter cries and\\nmake movements that rouse our feelings.': 76, 'We can make understanding pets of them with a mutual recognition.': 81, 'They can be tamed to selfrestraint towards us, domesticated and taught.': 107, 'That unusual growth of brain which is the central fact of Cainozoic times marks a new communication and\\ninterdependence of individuals.': 425, 'It foreshadows the development of human societies of which we shall soon be\\ntelling.': 261, 'As the Cainozoic period unrolled, the resemblance of its flora and fauna to the plants and animals that inhabit the\\nworld today increased.': 684, 'The big clumsy Uintatheres and Titanotheres, the Entelodonts and Hyracodons, big\\nclumsy brutes like nothing living, disappeared.': 283, 'On the other hand a series of forms led up by steady degrees from\\ngrotesque and clumsy predecessors to the giraffes, camels, horses, elephants, deer, dogs and lions and tigers of the\\nexisting world.': 655, 'The evolution of the horse is particularly legible upon the geological record.': 379, 'We have a fairly\\ncomplete series of forms from a small tapirlike ancestor in the early Cainozoic.': 222, 'Another line of development that\\nhas now been pieced together with some precision is that of the llamas and camels.': 148, 'Monkeys, Apes and Submen\\nNATURALISTS divide the class Mammalia into a number of orders.': 71, 'At the head of these is the order Primates,\\nwhich includes the lemurs, the monkeys, apes and man.': 242, 'Their classification was based originally upon anatomical\\nresemblances and took no account of any mental qualities.': 374, 'Now the past history of the Primates is one very difficult to decipher in the geological record.': 622, 'They are for the\\nmost part animals which live in forests like the lemurs and monkeys or in bare rocky places like the baboons.': 415, 'They are rarely drowned and covered up by sediment, nor are most of them very numerous species, and so they\\ndo not figure so largely among the fossils as the ancestors of the horses, camels and so

Ohio.': 233, 'There\\nwould be warmer spells of a few thousand years and relapses towards a bitterer cold.': 459, 'Geologists talk of these wintry phases as the First, Second, Third and Fourth Glacial

Glacial Ages that we find traces of creatures that we can speak\\nof as almost human.': 582, 'These traces are not bones but implements.': 55, 'In Europe, in deposits of this period, between\\nhalf a

and bones have been found of a sort of ape man, with a brain case bigger than that of any living apes, which\\nseems to have walked erect.': 645, 'This creature is now called Pithecanthropus erectus, the walking ape man, and the\\nlittle trayful of its bones is the only help our imaginations have as yet in figuring to ourselves the makers of the\\nEoliths.': 426, 'It is not until we come to sands that are almost a quarter of a million years old that we find any other particle of a\\nsubhuman being.': 420, 'But there are plenty of implements, and they are steadily improving in quality as we read on\\nthrough the record.': 115, 'They are no longer clumsy Eoliths they are now shapely instruments made with considerable\\nskill.': 255, 'And they are much bigger than the similar implements afterwards made by true man.': 591, 'Then, in a sandpit at\\nHeidelberg, appears a single quasihuman jawbone, a clumsy jawbone, absolutely chinless, far heavier than a\\ntrue human jawbone and narrower, so that it is improbable the creatures tongue could have moved about for\\narticulate speech.': 511, 'On the strength of this jawbone, scientific men suppose this creature to have been a heavy,\\nalmost human monster, possibly with huge limbs and hands, possibly with a thick felt of hair, and they call it the\\nHeidelberg Man.': 567, 'This jawbone is, I think, one of the most tormenting objects in the world to our human curiosity.': 894, 'To see it is like\\nlooking through a defective glass into the past and catching just one blurred and tantalizing glimpse of this

vanishes.': 4, 'Yet the soil is littered\\nabundantly with the indestructible implements he chipped out for his uses.': 42, 'Still more fascinatingly enigmatical are the remains of a creature found at

'Europe for example was covered with ice reaching as far south as the Thames and into Central Germany and\\nRussia there was no Channel separating Britain from France the Mediterranean and the Red Sea

which the Neanderthaler wandered, gathering such subsistence as he could from\\nsmall game or fruits and berries and roots.': 205, 'Possibly he was mainly a vegetarian, chewing twigs and roots.': 16, 'His\\nlevel elaborate teeth suggest a largely vegetarian dietary.': 79, 'But we also find the long marrow bones of great animals\\nin his caves, cracked to extract the marrow.': 738, 'His weapons could not have been of much avail in open conflict with\\ngreat beasts, but it is supposed that he attacked them with spears at difficult river crossings and even constructed\\npitfalls for them.': 887, 'Possibly he followed the herds and preyed upon any dead that were killed in fights, and perhaps\\nhe played the part of jackal to the sabretoothed tiger which still survived in his day.': 699, 'Possibly in the bitter\\nhardships of the Glacial Ages this creature had taken to attacking animals after long ages of vegetarian adaptation.': 203, 'We cannot guess what this Neanderthal man looked like.': 304, 'He may have been very hairy and very\\ninhumanlooking indeed.': 146, 'It is even doubtful if he went erect.': 186, 'He may have used his knuckles as well as his feet to\\nhold himself up.': 189, 'Probably he went about alone or in small family groups.': 178, 'It is inferred from the structure of his\\njaw that he was incapable of speech as we understand it.': 45, 'For thousands of years these Neanderthalers were the highest animals that the European area had ever seen and\\nthen some thirty or thirtyfive thousand years ago as the climate grew warmer a race of kindred beings,

from stimulation and improvement.': 446, 'They seem to have degenerated rather than\\ndeveloped.': 119, 'They lived a base life subsisting upon shellfish and small game.': 623, 'They had no

Thought\\nAND now let us indulge in a very interesting speculation how did it feel to be a man in those early days of the\\nhuman adventure How did men think and what did they think in those remote days of hunting and wandering\\nfour hundred centuries ago before seed time and harvest began.': 1355, 'Those were days long before the written record of\\nany human impressions, and we are left almost entirely to inference and guesswork in our answers to these\\nquestions.': 460, 'The sources to which scientific men have gone in their attempts to reconstruct that primitive mentality are very\\nvarious.': 376, 'Recently the science of psychoanalysis, which analyzes the way in which the egotistic and passionate\\nimpulses of the child are restrained, suppressed, modified or overlaid, to adapt them to the needs of social life,\\nseems to have thrown a considerable amount of light upon the history of primitive society and another fruitful\\nsource of suggestion has been the study of the ideas and customs of such contemporary savages as still survive.': 1567, 'Again there is a sort of mental fossilization which we find in folklore and the deeplying irrational superstitions\\nand prejudices that still survive among modern civilized people.': 675, 'And finally we have in the increasingly\\nnumerous pictures, statues, carvings, symbols and the like, as we draw near to our own time, clearer and clearer\\nindications of what man found interesting and worthy of record and representation.': 729, 'Primitive man probably thought very much as a child thinks, that is to say in a series of imaginative pictures.': 468, 'He\\nconjured up images or images presented themselves to his mind, and he acted in accordance with the emotions\\nthey aroused.': 95, 'So a child or an

'Most of the world still lives by imagination and passion.': 668, 'Probably the earliest human societies, in the opening stages of the true human story, were small family groups.': 518, 'Just as the flocks and herds of the earlier mammals arose out of families which remained together and multiplied,\\nso probably did the earliest tribes.': 321, 'But before this could happen a certain restraint upon the primitive egotisms of\\nthe individual had to be established.': 525, 'The fear of the father and respect for the mother had to be extended into adult\\nlife, and the natural jealousy of the old man of the group for the younger males as they grew up had to be\\nmitigated.': 656, 'The mother on the other hand was the natural adviser and protector of the young.': 112, 'Human social life\\ngrew up out of the reaction between the crude instinct of the young to go off and pair by themselves as they grew\\nup, on the one hand, and the dangers and disadvantages of separation on the other.': 744, 'An anthropological writer of\\ngreat genius, J. J. Atkinson, in his Primal Law, has shown how much of the customary law of savages, the Tabus,\\nthat are so remarkable a fact in tribal life, can be ascribed to such a mental adjustment of the needs of the\\nprimitive human animal to a developing social life, and the later work of the psychoanalysts has done much to\\nconfirm his interpretation of these possibilities.': 1742, 'Some speculative writers would have us believe that respect and fear of the Old Man and the emotional reaction\\nof the primitive savage to older protective women, exaggerated in dreams and enriched by fanciful mental play,\\nplayed a large part in the beginnings of primitive religion and in the conception of gods and goddesses.': 667, 'Associated with this respect for powerful or helpful personalities was a dread and exaltation of such personages\\nafter their deaths, due to their reappearance in dreams.': 57, 'It was easy to believe they were not truly dead but only\\nfantastically transferred to a remoteness of greater power.': 200, 'The dreams, imaginations and fears of a child are far more vivid and real than those of a modern adult, and\\nprimitive man was always something of a child.': 501, 'He was nearer to the animals also, and he could suppose them to\\nhave motives and reactions like his own.': 365, 'He could imagine animal helpers, animal enemies, animal gods.': 205, 'One\\nneeds to have been an imaginative child oneself to realize again how important, significant, portentous or friendly,\\nstrangely shaped rocks, lumps of wood, exceptional trees or the like may have appeared to the men of the Old\\nStone Age, and how dream and fancy would create stories and legends about such things that would become\\ncredible as they told them.': 1106, 'Some of these stories would be good enough to remember and tell again.': 275, 'The women\\nwould tell them to the children and so establish a tradition.': 271, 'To this day most imaginative children invent long\\nstories in which some favourite doll or animal or some fantastic semihuman being figures as the hero, and\\nprimitive man probably did the samewith a much stronger disposition to believe his hero real.': 642, 'For the very earliest of the true men that we know of were probably quite talkative beings.': 415, 'In that way they have\\ndiffered from the Neanderthalers and had an advantage over them.': 80, 'The Neanderthaler may have been a dumb\\nanimal.': 125, 'Of course the primitive human speech was probably a very scanty collection of names, and may have\\nbeen eked out with gestures and signs.': 423, 'There is no sort of savage so low as not to have a kind of science of cause and effect.': 179, 'But primitive man was not\\nvery critical in his associations of cause with effect he very easily connected an effect with something quite\\nwrong as its cause.': 379, 'You do so and so, he said, and so and so happens.': 30, 'You give a child a poisonous berry and\\nit dies.': 33, 'You eat the heart of a valiant enemy and you become strong.': 84, 'There we have two bits of cause and effect\\nassociation, one true one false.': 686, 'We call the system of cause and effect in the mind of a savage, Fetish but Fetish is\\nsimply savage science.': 252, 'It differs from modern science in that it is totally unsystematic and uncritical and so more\\nfrequently wrong.': 115, 'In many cases it is not difficult to link cause and effect, in many others erroneous ideas were soon corrected by\\nexperience but there was a large series of issues of very great importance to primitive man, where he sought\\npersistently for causes and found explanations that were wrong but not sufficiently wrong nor so obviously wrong\\nas to be detected.': 1294, 'It was a matter of great importance to him that game should be abundant or fish plentiful andA Short History of the World.': 522, 'Primitive Thought 19easily caught, and no doubt he tried and believed in a thousand charms, incantations and omens to determine these\\ndesirable results.': 126, 'Another great concern of his was illness and death.': 483, 'Occasionally infections crept through the\\nland and men died of them.': 317, 'Occasionally men were stricken by illness and died or were enfeebled without any\\nmanifest cause.': 314, 'This too must have given the hasty, emotional mind of primitive man much feverish exercise.': 512, 'Dreams and fantastic guesses made him blame this, or appeal for help to that man or beast or thing.': 452, 'He had the\\nchilds aptitude for fear and panic.': 20, 'Quite early in the little human tribe, older, steadier minds sharing the fears, sharing the imaginations, but a little\\nmore forceful than the others, must have asserted themselves, to advise, to prescribe, to command.': 557, 'This they\\ndeclared unpropitious and that imperative, this an omen of good and that an omen of evil.': 56, 'The expert in Fetish, the\\nMedicine Man, was the first priest.': 293, 'He exhorted, he interpreted dreams, he warned, he performed the complicated\\nhocus pocus that brought luck or averted calamity.': 92, 'Primitive religion was not so much what we now call religion\\nas practice and observance, and the early priest dictated what was indeed an arbitrary primitive practical science.': 513, 'The Beginnings of Cultivation\\nWE are still very ignorant about the beginnings of cultivation and settlement in the world although a vast amount\\nof research and speculation has been given to these matters in the last fifty years.': 1071, 'All that we can say with any\\nconfidence at present is that somewhen about 15,000 and 12,000 B.C.': 66, 'while the Azilian people were in the south\\nof Spain and while the remnants of the earlier hunters were drifting northward and eastward, somewhere in North\\nAfrica or Western Asia or in that great Mediterranean valley that is now submerged under the waters of the\\nMediterranean sea, there were people who, age by age, were working out two vitally important things they were\\nbeginning cultivation and they were domesticating animals.': 1729, 'They were also beginning to make, in addition to the\\nchipped implements of their hunter forebears, implements of polished stone.': 268, 'They had discovered the possibility\\nof basketwork and roughly woven textiles of plant fibre, and they were beginning to make a rudely modelled\\npottery.': 150, 'They were entering upon a new phase in human culture, the Neolithic phase New Stone Age as distinguished\\nfrom the Palaeolithic Old Stone phase of the CroMagnards, the Grimaldi people, the Azilians and their like.': 1180, 'Slowly these Neolithic people spread over the warmer parts of the world and the arts they had mastered, the\\nplants and animals they had learnt to use, spread by imitation and acquisition even more widely than they did.': 1047, 'By\\n10,000 B.C., most of mankind was at the Neolithic level.': 74, 'Now the ploughing of land, the sowing of seed, the reaping of harvest, threshing and grinding, may seem the most\\nobviously reasonable steps to a modern mind just as to a modern mind it is a commonplace that the world is\\nround.': 1003, 'What else could you do people will ask.': 330, 'What else can it be But to the primitive man of twenty thousand\\nyears ago neither of the systems of action and reasoning that seem so sure and manifest to us today were at all\\nobvious.': 672, 'He felt his way to effectual practice through a multitude of trials and misconceptions, with fantastic and\\nunnecessary elaborations and false interpretations at every turn.': 211, 'Somewhere in the Mediterranean region, wheat\\ngrew wild and man way have learnt to pound and then grind up its seeds for food long before he learnt to sow.': 466, 'He reaped before he sowed.': 2, 'And it is a very remarkable thing that throughout the world wherever there is sowing and harvesting there is still\\ntraceable the vestiges of a strong primitive association of the idea of sowing with the idea of a blood sacrifice, and\\nprimarily of the sacrifice of a human being.': 1144, 'The study of the original entanglement of these two things is a\\nprofoundly attractive one to the curious mind the interested reader will find it very fully developed in that\\nmonumental work, Sir J. G. Frazers Golden Bough.': 700, 'It was an entanglement, we must remember, in the childish,\\ndreaming, mythmaking primitive mind no reasoned process will explain it.': 232, 'But in that world of 12,000 to\\n20,000 years ago, it would seem that whenever seed time came round to the Neolithic peoples there was a human\\nsacrifice.': 1554, 'And it was not the sacrifice of any mean or outcast person it was the sacrifice usually of a chosen youthA Short History of the World.': 55, 'The Beginnings of Cultivation 20or maiden, a youth more often who was treated with profound deference and even worship up to the moment of\\nhis immolation.': 149, 'He was a sort of sacrificial godking, and all the details of his killing had become a ritual directed\\nby the old, knowing men and sanctioned by the accumulated usage of ages.': 444, 'At first primitive men, with only a very rough idea of the seasons, must have found great difficulty in determining\\nwhen was the propitious moment for the seedtime sacrifice and the sowing.': 1188, 'There is some reason for supposing\\nthat there was an early stage in human experience when men had no idea of a year.': 536, 'The first chronology was in\\nlunar months it is supposed that the years of the Biblical patriarchs are really moons, and the Babylonian calendar\\nshows distinct traces of an attempt to reckon seed time by taking thirteen lunar months to see it round.': 818, 'This lunar\\ninfluence upon the calendar reaches down to our own days.': 383, 'If usage did not dull our sense of its strangeness we\\nshould think it a very remarkable thing indeed that the Christian Church does not commemorate the Crucifixion\\nand Resurrection of Christ on the proper anniversaries but on dates that vary year by year with the phases of the\\nmoon.': 239, 'It may be doubted whether the first agriculturalists made any observation of the stars.': 585, 'It is more likely that stars\\nwere first observed by migratory herdsmen, who found them a convenient mark of direction.': 402, 'But once their use in\\ndetermining seasons was realized, their importance to agriculture became very great.': 631, 'The seedtime sacrifice was\\nlinked up with the southing or northing of some prominent star.': 38, 'A myth and worship of that star was for primitive\\nman an almost inevitable consequence.': 298, 'It is easy to see how important the man of knowledge and experience, the man who knew about the blood\\nsacrifice and the stars, became in this early Neolithic world.': 1164, 'The fear of uncleanness and pollution, and the methods of cleansing that were advisable, constituted another\\nsource of power for the knowledgeable men and women.': 459, 'For there have always been witches as well as wizards,\\nand priestesses as well as priests.': 124, 'The early priest was really not so much a religious man as a man of applied\\nscience.': 687, 'His science was generally empirical and often bad he kept it secret from the generality of men very\\njealously but that does not alter the fact that his primary function was knowledge and that his primary use was a\\npractical use.': 511, 'Twelve or fifteen thousand years ago, in all the warm and fairly wellwatered parts of the Old World these\\nNeolithic human communities, with their class and tradition of priests and priestesses and their cultivated fields\\nand their development of villages and little walled cities, were spreading.': 812, 'Age by age a drift and exchange of\\nideas went on between these communities.': 324, 'Eliot Smith and Rivers have used the term Heliolithic culture for the\\nculture of these first agricultural peoples.': 442, 'Heliolithic Sun and Stone is not perhaps the best possible word to\\nuse for this, but until scientific men give us a better one we shall have to use it.': 735, 'Originating somewhere in the\\nMediterranean and western Asiatic area, it spread age by age eastward and from island to island across the Pacific\\nuntil it may even have reached America and mingled with the more primitive ways of living of the Mongoloid\\nimmigrants coming down from the North.': 840, 'Wherever the brownish people with the Heliolithic culture went they took with them all or most of a certain group\\nof curious ideas and practices.': 546, 'Some of them are such queer ideas that they call for the explanation of the mental\\nexpert.': 125, 'They made pyramids and great mounds, and set up great circles of big stones, perhaps to facilitate the\\nastronomical observation of the priests they made mummies of some or all of their dead they tattooed and\\ncircumcized they had the old custom, known as the couvade, of sending the father to bed and rest when a child\\nwas born, and they had as a luck symbol the wellknown Swastika.': 1698, 'If we were to make a map of the world with dots to show how far these group practices have left their traces, we\\nshould make a belt along the temperate and subtropical coasts of the world from Stonehenge and Spain across\\nthe world to Mexico and Peru.': 1848, 'But Africa below the equator, north central Europe, and north Asia would show\\nnone of these dottings there lived races who were developing

implements.': 366, 'The\\nprehuman age is called the Older Palaeolithic, the age of true men using unpolished stones in the Newer\\nPalaeolithic.': 564, 'the geography of the world was very similar in its general outline to that of the world\\ntoday.': 1087, 'It is probable that by that time the great barrier across the Straits of Gibraltar that had hitherto banked\\nback the ocean waters from the Mediterranean valley had been eaten through, and that the Mediterranean was a\\nsea following much the same coastlines as it does now.': 1034, 'The Caspian Sea was probably still far more extensive\\nthan it is at present, and it may have been continuous with the Black Sea to the north of the Caucasus Mountains.': 560, 'About this great Central Asian sea lands that are now steppes and deserts were fertile and habitable.': 584, 'Generally it\\nwas a moister and more fertile world.': 483, 'European Russia was much more a land of swamp and lake than it is now,\\nand there may still have been a land connexion between Asia and America at Behring Straits.': 566, 'It would have been already possible at that time to have distinguished the main racial divisions of mankind as we\\nknow them today.': 656, 'Across the warm temperate regions of this rather warmer and betterwooded world, and along\\nthe coasts, stretched the brownish peoples of the Heliolithic culture, the ancestors of the bulk of the living\\ninhabitants of the Mediterranean world, of the Berbers, the Egyptians and of much of the population of South and\\nEastern Asia.': 1467, 'This great race had of course a number of varieties.': 555, 'The Iberian or Mediterranean or darkwhite\\nrace of the Atlantic and Mediterranean coast, the Hamitic peoples which include the Berbers and Egyptians, the\\nDravidians, the darker people of India, a multitude of East Indian people, many Polynesian races and the Maoris\\nare all divisions of various value of this great main mass of humanity.': 1302, 'Its western varieties are whiter than its\\neastern.': 94, 'In the forests of central and northern Europe a more blonde variety of men with blue eyes was becoming\\ndistinguishable, branching off from the main mass of brownish people, a variety which many people now speak of\\nas the Nordic race.': 1016, 'In the more open regions of northeastern Asia was another differentiation of this brownish\\nhumanity in the direction of a type with more oblique eyes, high cheekbones, a yellowish skin, and very straight\\nblack hair, the Mongolian peoples.': 337, 'In South Africa, Australia, in many tropical islands in the south of Asia were\\nremains of the early negroid peoples.': 399, 'The central parts of Africa were already a region of racial intermixture.': 163, 'Nearly all the coloured races of Africa today seem to be blends of the brownish peoples of the north with a\\nnegroid substratum.': 323, 'We have to remember that human races can all interbreed freely and that they separate, mingle and reunite as\\nclouds do.': 192, 'Human races do not branch out like trees with branches that never come together again.': 333, 'It is a thing we\\nneed to bear constantly in mind, this remingling of races at any opportunity.': 166, 'It will save us from many cruel\\ndelusions and prejudices if we do so.': 152, 'People will use such a word as race in the loosest manner, and base the most\\npreposterous generalizations upon it.': 391, 'They will speak of a British race or of a European race.': 94, 'But nearly all\\nthe European nations are confused mixtures of brownish, darkwhite, white and Mongolian elements.': 82, 'It was at the Neolithic phase of human development that peoples of the Mongolian breed first made their way into\\nAmerica.': 864, 'Apparently they came by way of Behring Straits and spread southward.': 288, 'They found caribou, the\\nAmerican reindeer, in the north and great herds of bison in the south.': 715, 'When they reached South America there\\nwere still living the Glyptodon, a gigantic armadillo, and the Megatherium, a monstrous clumsy sloth as high as\\nan elephant.': 303, 'They probably exterminated the latter beast, which was as helpless as it was big.': 107, 'The greater portion of these American tribes never rose above a hunting nomadic Neolithic life.': 408, 'They never\\ndiscovered the use of iron, and their chief metal possessions were native gold and copper.': 247, 'But in Mexico, Yucatan\\nand Peru conditions existed favourable to settled cultivation, and here about 1000 B.C.': 109, 'or so arose very interesting\\ncivilizations of a parallel but different type from the oldworld civilization.': 238, 'Like the much earlier primitive\\ncivilizations of the old world these communities displayed a

of accuracy.': 191, 'They knew their year better than the\\nBabylonians of whom we shall presently tell.': 163, 'In Yucatan they had a kind of writing, the Maya writing, of the most\\ncurious and elaborate character.': 110, 'So far as we have been able to decipher it, it was used mainly for keeping the\\nexact and complicated calendars upon which the priests expended their intelligence.': 557, 'The art of the Maya\\ncivilization came to a climax about 700 or 800 A.D.': 233, 'The sculptured work of these people amazes the modern\\nobserver by its great plastic power and its frequent beauty,

nearest approach, and that is a remote one, is found in archaic Indian carvings.': 350, 'Everywhere there are woven\\nfeathers and serpents twine in and out.': 14, 'Many Maya inscriptions resemble a certain sort of elaborate drawing made\\nby lunatics in European asylums, more than any other oldworld work.': 374, 'It is as if the Maya mind had developed\\nupon a different line from the oldworld mind, had a different twist to its ideas, was not, by oldworld standards,\\na rational mind at all.': 747, 'This linking of these aberrant American civilizations to the idea of a general mental aberration finds support in\\ntheir extraordinary obsession by the shedding of human blood.': 355, 'The Mexican civilization in particular ran blood it\\noffered thousands of human victims yearly.': 257, 'The cutting open of living victims, the tearing out of the still beating\\nheart, was an act that dominated the minds and lives of these strange priesthoods.': 349, 'The public life, the national\\nfestivities all turned on this fantastically horrible act.': 321, 'The ordinary existence of the common people in these communities was very like the ordinary existence of any\\nother

European and American museums contain\\nmany enigmatical Maya manuscripts of which at present little has been deciphered except the dates.': 261, 'In Peru there\\nwere beginnings of a similar writing but they were superseded by a method of keeping records by knotting cords.': 118, 'A similar method of mnemonics was in use in China thousands of years ago.': 289, 'In the old world before 4000 or 5000 B.C., that is to say three or four thousand years earlier, there were primitive\\ncivilizations not unlike these American civilizations civilizations based upon a temple, having a vast quantity of\\nblood sacrifices and with an intensely astronomical priesthood.': 1508, 'But in the old world the primitive civilizations\\nreacted upon one another and developed towards the conditions of our

use these picture scripts they were to make those further\\nmodifications and simplifications that developed at last into alphabetical writing.': 491, 'All the true alphabets of the later\\nworld derived from a mixture of the Sumerian cuneiform and the Egyptian hieroglyphic priest writing.': 643, 'Later in\\nChina there was to develop a conventionalized picture writing, but in China it never got to the alphabetical stage.': 169, 'The invention of writing was of very great importance in the development of human societies.': 719, 'It put agreements,\\nlaws, commandments on record.': 83, 'It made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible.': 613, 'It made a\\ncontinuous historical consciousness possible.': 241, 'The command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond\\nhis sight and voice and could survive his death.': 524, 'It is interesting to note that in ancient Sumeria seals were greatly\\nused.': 146, 'A king or a nobleman or a merchant would have his seal often very artistically carved, and would impress it\\non any clay document he wished to authorize.': 487, 'So close had civilization got to printing six thousand years ago.': 363, 'Then the clay was dried hard and became permanent.': 137, 'For the reader must remember that in the land of\\nMesopotamia for countless years, letters, records and accounts were all written on comparatively

people in peace time were busy with irrigation and\\ncultivationexcept on days of religious festivity.': 632, 'They had no money and no need for it.': 29, 'They managed their\\nsmall occasional trades by barter.': 73, 'The princes and rulers who alone had more than a few possessions used gold\\nand silver bars and precious stones for any incidental act of trade.': 209, 'The temple dominated life in Sumeria it was a\\ngreat towering temple that went up to a roof from which the stars were observed in Egypt it was a massive\\nbuilding with only a ground floor.': 879, 'In Sumeria the priest ruler was the greatest, most splendid of beings.': 82, 'In Egypt\\nhowever there was one who was raised above the priests he was the living incarnation of the chief god of the\\nland, the Pharaoh, the god king.': 742, 'There were few changes in the world in those days mens days were sunny, toilsome and conventional.': 672, 'Few\\nstrangers came into the land and such as did fared uncomfortably.': 235, 'The priest directed life according to\\nimmemorial rules and watched the stars for seed time and marked the omens of the sacrifices and interpreted the\\nwarnings of dreams.': 547, 'Men worked and loved and died, not unhappily, forgetful of the savage past of their race and\\nheedless of its future.': 141, 'Sometimes the ruler was benign.': 11, 'Such was Pepi II, who reigned in Egypt for ninety years.': 170, 'Sometimes he was ambitious and took mens sons to be soldiers and sent them against neighbouring city states to\\nwar and plunder, or he made them toil to build great buildings.': 1078, 'Such were Cheops and Chephren and Mycerinus,\\nwho built those vast sepulchral piles, the pyramids at Gizeh.': 75, 'The largest of these is 450 feet high and the weight\\nof stone in it is 4,883,000

'Primitive Nomadic Peoples\\nIT was not only in Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley that men were settling down to agriculture and the formation\\nof city states in the centuries between 6000 and 3000 B.C.': 484, 'Wherever there were possibilities of irrigation and a\\nsteady alltheyearround food supply men were exchanging the uncertainties and hardships of hunting and\\nwandering for the routines of settlement.': 295, 'On the upper Tigris a people called the Assyrians were founding cities\\nin the valleys of Asia Minor and on the Mediterranean shores and islands, there were small communities growing\\nup to civilization.': 578, 'Possibly parallel developments of human life were already going on in favourable regions of\\nIndia and China.': 528, 'In many parts of Europe where there were lakes well stocked with fish, little communities of\\nmen had long settled in dwellings built on piles over the water, and were eking out agriculture by fishing and\\nhunting.': 653, 'But over much larger areas of the old world no such settlement was possible.': 779, 'The land was too harsh, too\\nthickly wooded or too arid, or the seasons too uncertain for mankind, with only the implements and science of that\\nage to take root.': 380, 'For settlement under the conditions of the primitive civilizations men needed a constant water supply and warmth\\nand sunshine.': 433, 'Where these needs were not satisfied, man could live as a transient, as a hunter following his game,\\nas a herdsman following the seasonal grass, but he could not settle.': 418, 'The transition from the hunting to the herding\\nlife may have been very gradual.': 348, 'From following herds of wild cattle or in Asia wild horses, men may have\\ncome to an idea of property in them, have learnt to pen them into valleys, have fought for them against wolves,\\nwild dogs and other predatory beasts.': 592, 'So while the primitive civilizations of the cultivators were growing up chiefly in the great river valleys, a different\\nway of living, the nomadic life, a life in constant movement to and fro from winter pasture to summer pasture,\\nwas also growing up.': 1467, 'The nomadic peoples were on the whole hardier than the agriculturalists they were less\\nprolific and numerous, they had no permanent temples and no highly organized priesthood they had less gear but\\nthe reader must not suppose that theirs was necessarily a less highly developed way of living on that account.': 637, 'In\\nmany ways this free life was a fuller life than that of the tillers of the soil.': 616, 'The individual was more

stretches of country the nomad took a wider view of life.': 375, 'He touched on the confines of this\\nsettled land and that.': 105, 'He was used to the sight of strange faces.': 58, 'He had to scheme and treat for pasture with\\ncompeting tribes.': 68, 'He knew more of minerals than the folk upon the plough lands because he went over mountain\\npasses and into rocky places.': 451, 'He may have been a better metallurgist.': 125, 'Possibly bronze and much more probably\\niron smelting were nomadic discoveries.': 246, 'Some of the earliest implements of iron reduced from its ores have been\\nfound in Central Europe far away from the early civilizations.': 425, 'On the other hand the settled folk had their textiles and their pottery and made many desirable things.': 426, 'It was\\ninevitable that as the two sorts of life, the agricultural and the nomadic differentiated, a certain amount of looting\\nand trading should develop between the two.': 606, 'In Sumeria particularly which had deserts and seasonal country on\\neither hand it must have been usual to have the nomads camping close to the cultivated fields, trading and stealing\\nand perhaps tinkering, as gipsies do to this day.': 359, 'But hens they would not steal, because the domestic fowlan\\nIndian jungle fowl originallywas not domesticated by man until about 1000 B.C.': 371, 'They would bring precious\\nstones and things of metal and leather.': 289, 'If they were hunters they would bring skins.': 200, 'They would get in exchange\\npottery and beads and glass, garments and suchlike manufactured things.': 294, 'Three main regions and three main kinds of wandering and imperfectly settled people there were in those remote\\ndays of the first civilizations in Sumeria and early Egypt.': 833, 'Away in the forests of Europe were the blonde Nordic\\npeoples, hunters and herdsmen, a lowly race.': 172, 'The primitive civilizations saw very little of this race before 1500\\nB.C.': 257, 'Away on the steppes of eastern Asia various Mongolian tribes, the Hunnish peoples, were domesticating the\\nhorse and developing a very wide sweeping habit of seasonal movement between their summer and winter\\ncamping places.': 325, 'Possibly the Nordic and Hunnish peoples were still separated from one another by the swamps of\\nRussia and the greater Caspian Sea of that time.': 809, 'For very much of Russia there was swamp and lake.': 148, 'In the\\ndeserts, which were growing more arid now, of Syria and Arabia, tribes of a dark white or brownish people, the\\nSemitic tribes, were driving flocks of sheep and goats and asses from pasture to pasture.': 422, 'It was these Semitic\\nshepherds and certain more negroid people from southern Persia, the Elamites, who were the first nomads to come\\ninto close contact with the early civilizations.': 774, 'They came as traders and as raiders.': 164, 'Finally there arose leaders\\namong them with bolder imaginations, and they became conquerors.': 244, 'About 2750 B.C.': 1, 'a great Semitic leader, Sargon, had conquered the whole Sumerian land and was master of all\\nthe world from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea.': 1122, 'He was an illiterate barbarian and his people, the\\nAkkadians, learnt the Sumerian writing and adopted the Sumerian language as the speech of the officials and the\\nlearned.': 394, 'The empire he founded decayed after two centuries, and after one inundation of Elamites a fresh Semitic\\npeople, the Amorites, by degrees established their rule over Sumeria.': 1021, 'They made their capital in what had hitherto\\nbeen a small upriver town, Babylon, and their empire is called the first Babylonian Empire.': 855, 'It was consolidated\\nby a great king called Hammurabi circa 2100 B.C.': 594, 'who made the earliest code of laws yet known to history.': 593, 'The narrow valley of the Nile lies less open to nomadic invasion than Mesopotamia, but about the time of\\nHammurabi occurred a successful Semitic invasion of Egypt and a line of Pharaohs was set up, the Hyksos or\\nshepherd kings, which lasted for several centuries.': 589, 'These Semitic conquerors never assimilated themselves with\\nthe Egyptians they were always regarded with hostility as foreigners and barbarians and they were at last\\nexpelled by a popular uprising about 1600 B.C.': 288, 'But the Semites had come into Sumeria for good and all, the two races assimilated and the Babylonian Empire\\nbecame Semitic in its language and character.': 381, 'The First Seagoing Peoples\\nTHE EARLIEST

crossing of Behring Straits.': 293, 'The hollow log\\nfollowed as tools improved.': 58, 'The building of boats and then ships came in a natural succession.': 240, 'Perhaps the legend of Noahs Ark preserves the memory of some early exploit in shipbuilding, just as the story of\\nthe Flood, so widely distributed among the peoples of the world, may be the tradition of the flooding of the\\nMediterranean basin.': 923, 'There were ships upon the Red Sea long before the pyramids were built, and there were ships on the\\nMediterranean and Persian Gulf by 7000 B.C.': 454, 'Mostly these were the ships of fishermen, but some were already\\ntrading and pirate shipsfor knowing what we do of mankind we may guess pretty safely that the first sailors\\nplundered where they could and traded where they had to do so.': 667, 'The seas on which these first ships adventured were inland seas on which the wind blew fitfully and which were\\noften at a dead calm for days together, so that sailing did not develop beyond an accessory use.': 605, 'It is only in the\\nlast four hundred years that the wellrigged, oceangoing, sailing ship has developed.': 391, 'The ships of the ancient\\nworld were essentially rowing ships which hugged the shore and went into harbour at the first sign of rough\\nweather.': 971, 'As ships grew into big galleys they caused a demand for war captives as galley slaves.': 295, 'We have already noted the appearance of the Semitic people as wanderers and nomads in the region of Syria and\\nArabia, and how they conquered Sumeria and set up first the Akkadian and then the first Babylonian Empire.': 1007, 'In\\nthe west these same Semitic peoples were taking to the sea.': 240, 'They set up a string of harbour towns along the\\nEastern coast of the Mediterranean, of which Type and Sidon were the chief and by the time of Hammurabi in\\nBabylon, they had spread as traders, wanderers and colonizers over the whole Mediterranean basin.': 504, 'These sea\\nSemites were called the Phoenicians.': 133, 'They settled largely in Spain, pushing back the old Iberian Basque\\npopulation and sending coasting expeditions through the straits of Gibraltar and they set up colonies upon the\\nnorth coast of Africa.': 757, 'Of Carthage, one of these Phoenicians cities, we shall have much more to tell later.': 558, 'But the Phoenicians were not the first people to have galleys in the Mediterranean waters.': 517, 'There was already a\\nseries of towns and cities among the islands and coasts of that sea belonging to a race or races apparently\\nconnected by blood and language with the Basques to the west and the Berbers and Egyptians to the south, the\\naegean peoples.': 750, 'These peoples must not be confused with the Greeks, who come much later into our story they\\nwere preGreek, but they had cities in Greece and Asia Minor, Mycenae and Troy for example, and they had a\\ngreat and prosperous establishment at Cnossos in Crete.': 1009, 'It is only in the last half century that the industry of excavating archaeologists has brought the extent and\\ncivilization of the aegean peoples to our knowledge.': 649, 'Cnossos has

his tomb so that he should not go unattended and unarmed in the spirit world.': 1284, 'In Egypt there\\nsurvived of this dark tradition the pleasant custom of burying small models of house and shop and servants and\\ncattle with the dead, models that give us today the liveliest realization of the safe and cultivated life of these\\nancient people, three thousand years and more ago.A Short History of the World.': 1071, 'Egypt, Babylon and Assyria 30Such was the ancient world before the coming of the Aryans out of the northern forests and plains.': 610, 'In India and\\nChina there were parallel developments.': 30, 'In the great valleys of both these regions agricultural city states of\\nbrownish peoples were growing up, but in India they do not seem to have advanced or coalesced so rapidly as the\\ncity states of Mesopotamia or Egypt.': 1050, 'They were nearer the level of the ancient Sumerians or of the Maya\\ncivilization of America.': 134, 'Chinese history has still to be modernized by Chinese scholars and cleared of much\\nlegendary matter.': 620, 'Probably China at this time was in advance of India.': 218, 'Contemporary with the seventeenth\\ndynasty in Egypt, there was a dynasty of emperors in China, the Shang dynasty, priest emperors over a looseknit\\nempire of subordinate kings.': 485, 'The chief duty of these early emperors was to perform the seasonal sacrifices.': 170, 'Beautiful bronze vessels from the time of the Shang dynasty still exist, and their beauty and workmanship compel\\nus to recognize that many centuries of civilization must have preceded their manufacture.': 774, 'The Primitive Aryans\\nFOUR thousand years ago, that is to say about 2000 B.C., central and southeastern Europe and central Asia were\\nprobably warmer, moister and better wooded than they are now.': 456, 'In these regions of the earth wandered a group of\\ntribes mainly of the fair and blueeyed Nordic race, sufficiently in touch with one another to speak merely\\nvariations of one common language from the Rhine to the Caspian Sea.': 910, 'At that time they may not have been a\\nvery numerous people, and their existence was unsuspected by the Babylonians to whom Hammurabi was giving\\nlaws, or by the already ancient and cultivated land of Egypt which was tasting in those days for the first time the\\nbitterness of foreign conquest.': 1385, 'These Nordic people were destined to play a very important part indeed in the worlds history.': 687, 'They were a people\\nof the parklands and the forest clearings they had no horses at first but they had cattle when they wandered they\\nput their tents and other gear on rough ox waggons when they settled for a time they may have made huts of\\nwattle and mud.': 1109, 'They burnt their important dead they did not bury them ceremoniously as the brunette peoples\\ndid.': 170, 'They put the ashes of their greater leaders in urns and then made a great circular mound about them.': 705, 'These\\nmounds are the round barrows that occur all over north Europe.': 134, 'The brunette people, their predecessors, did not\\nburn their dead but buried them in a sitting position in elongated mounds the long barrows.': 374, 'The Aryans raised crops of wheat, ploughing with oxen, but they did not settle down by their crops they would\\nreap and move on.': 215, 'They had bronze, and somewhen about 1500 B.C.': 19, 'they acquired iron.': 32, 'They may have been the\\ndiscoverers of iron smelting.': 134, 'And somewhen vaguely about that time they also got the horsewhich to begin with\\nthey used only for draught purposes.': 383, 'Their social life did not centre upon a temple like that of the more settled\\npeople round the Mediterranean, and their chief men were leaders rather than priests.': 1400, 'They had an aristocratic\\nsocial order rather than a divine and regal order from a very early stage they distinguished certain families as\\nleaderly and noble.': 390, 'They were a very vocal people.': 235, 'They enlivened their wanderings by feasts, at which there was much drunkenness\\nand at which a special sort of man, the bards, would sing and recite.': 555, 'They had no writing until they had come into\\ncontact with civilization, and the memories of these bards were their living literature.': 229, 'This use of recited language\\nas an entertainment did much to make it a fine and beautiful instrument of expression, and to that no doubt the\\nsubsequent predominance of the languages derived from Aryan is, in part, to be ascribed.': 432, 'Every Aryan people had\\nits legendary history crystallized in bardic recitations, epics, sagas and vedas, as they were variously called.': 592, 'The social life of these people centred about the households of their leading men.': 761, 'The hall of the chief where they\\nsettled for a time was often a very capacious timber building.': 297, 'There were no doubt huts for herds and outlying\\nfarm buildings but with most of the Aryan peoples this hall was the general centre, everyone went there to feast\\nand hear the bards and take part in games and discussions.': 421, 'Cowsheds and stabling surrounded it.': 5, 'The chief and his\\nwife and so forth would sleep on a dais or in an upper gallery the commoner sort slept about anywhere, as people\\nstill do in Indian households.': 713, 'Except for weapons,

and grazing lands in the common interest\\nforest and rivers were the wild.': 204, 'This was the fashion of the people who were increasing and multiplying over the great spaces of central Europe\\nand west central Asia during the growth of the great civilization of Mesopotamia and the Nile, and whom we find\\npressing upon the heliolithic peoples everywhere in the second millennium before Christ.': 1911, 'They were coming into\\nFrance and Britain and into Spain.': 27, 'They pushed westward in two waves.': 156, 'The first of these people who reached\\nBritain and Ireland were armed with bronze weapons.': 558, 'They exterminated or subjugated the people who had made\\nthe great stone monuments of Carnac in Brittany and Stonehenge and Avebury in England.': 898, 'They reached Ireland.': 37, 'They are called the Goidelic Celts.': 51, 'The second wave of a closely kindred people, perhaps intermixed with other\\nracial elements, brought iron with it into Great Britain, and is known as the wave of Brythonic Celts.': 461, 'From them\\nthe Welsh derive their language.': 38, 'Kindred Celtic peoples were pressing southward into Spain and coming into contact not only with the heliolithic\\nBasque people who still occupied the country but with the Semitic Phoenician colonies of the sea coast.': 744, 'A closely\\nallied series of tribes, the Italians, were making their way down the still wild and wooded Italian peninsula.': 364, 'They\\ndid not always conquer.': 24, 'In the eighth century B.C.': 220, 'Rome appears in history, a trading town on the Tiber,\\ninhabited by Aryan Latins but under the rule of Etruscan nobles and kings.': 425, 'At the other extremity of the Aryan range there was a similar progress southward of similar tribes.': 153, 'Aryan peoples,\\nspeaking Sanskrit, had come down through the western passes into North India long before 1000 B.C.': 333, 'There they\\ncame into contact with a primordial brunette civilization, the Dravidian civilization, and learnt much from it.': 446, 'Other Aryan tribes seem to have spread over the mountain masses of Central Asia far to the east of the present\\nrange of such peoples.': 485, 'In Eastern Turkestan there are still fair, blueeyed Nordic tribes, but now they speak\\nMongolian tongues.': 222, 'Between the Black and Caspian Seas the ancient Hittites had been submerged and Aryanized by the Armenians\\nbefore 1000 B.C., and the Assyrians and Babylonians were already aware of a new and formidable fighting\\nbarbarism on the northeastern frontiers, a group of tribes amidst which the Scythians, the Medes and the Persians\\nremain as outstanding names.': 554, 'But it was through the Balkan peninsula that Aryan tribes made their first heavy thrust into the heart of the\\noldworld civilization.': 603, 'They were already coming southward and crossing into Asia Minor many centuries before\\n1000 B.C.': 323, 'First came a group of tribes of whom the Phrygians were the most conspicuous, and then in succession\\nthe aeolic, the Ionic and the Dorian Greeks.': 237, 'By 1000 B.C.': 12, 'they had wiped out the ancient aegean civilization both\\nin the mainland of Greece and in most of the Greek islands the cities of Mycenae and Tiryns were obliterated and\\nCnossos was nearly forgotten.': 263, 'The Greeks had taken to the sea before 1000 A.D., they had settled in Crete and\\nRhodes, and they were founding colonies in Sicily and the south of Italy after the fashion of the Phoenician\\ntrading cities that were dotted along the Mediterranean coasts.': 398, 'So it was, while Tiglath Pileser III and Sargon II and Sardanapalus were ruling in Assyria and fighting with\\nBabylonia and Syria and Egypt, the Aryan peoples were learning the methods of civilization and making it over\\nfor their own purposes in Italy and Greece and north Persia.': 353, 'The theme of history from the ninth century B.C.': 509, 'onward for six centuries is the story of how these Aryan peoples grew to power and enterprise and how at last\\nthey subjugated the whole Ancient World, Semitic, aegean and Egyptian alike.': 653, 'In form the Aryan peoples were\\naltogether victorious but the struggle of Aryan, Semitic and Egyptian ideas and methods was continued long after\\nthe sceptre was in Aryan hands.': 457, 'It is indeed a struggle that goes on through all the rest of history and still in a\\nmanner continues to this day.A Short History of the World.': 575, 'The Last Babylonian Empire and the Empire of Darius I\\nWE have already mentioned how Assyria became a great military power under Tiglath Pileser III and under the\\nusurper Sargon II.': 793, 'Sargon was not this mans original name he adopted it to flatter the conquered Babylonians by\\nreminding them of that ancient founder of the Akkadian Empire, Sargon I, two thousand years before his time.': 682, 'Babylon, for all that it was a conquered city, was of greater population and importance than Nineveh, and its great\\ngod Bel Marduk and its traders and priests had to be treated politely.': 806, 'In Mesopotamia in the eighth century B.C.': 220, 'we are already far beyond the barbaric days when the capture of a town meant loot and massacre.': 350, 'Conquerors\\nsought to propitiate and win the conquered.': 67, 'For a century and a half after Sargon the new Assyrian empire\\nendured and, as we have noted, Assurbanipal Sardanapalus held at least lower Egypt.': 836, 'But the power and solidarity of Assyria waned rapidly.': 151, 'Egypt by an effort threw off the foreigner under a Pharoah\\nPsammetichus I, and under Necho II attempted a war of conquest in Syria.': 189, 'By that time Assyria was grappling\\nwith foes nearer at hand, and could make but a poor resistance.': 406, 'A Semitic people from southeast Mesopotamia,\\nthe Chaldeans, combined with Aryan Medes and Persians from the northeast against Nineveh, and in 606\\nB.C.for now we are coming down to exact chronologytook that city.': 372, 'There was a division of the spoils of Assyria.': 22, 'A Median Empire was set up in the north under Cyaxares.': 165, 'It\\nincluded Nineveh, and its capital was Ecbatana.': 23, 'Eastward it reached to the borders of India.': 46, 'To the south of this in\\na great crescent was a new Chaldean Empire, the Second Babylonian Empire, which rose to a very great degree of\\nwealth and power under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar the Great the Nebuchadnezzar of the Bible.': 1442, 'The last great\\ndays, the greatest days of all, for Babylon began.': 779, 'For a time the two Empires remained at peace, and the daughter\\nof Nebuchadnezzar was married to Cyaxares.': 449, 'Meanwhile Necho II was pursuing his easy conquests in Syria.': 33, 'He had defeated and slain King Josiah of Judah, a\\nsmall country of which there is more to tell presently, at the battle of Megiddo in 608 B.C., and he pushed on to\\nthe Euphrates to encounter not a decadent Assyria but a renascent Babylonia.': 295, 'The Chaldeans dealt very\\nvigorously with the Egyptians.': 5, 'Necho was routed and driven back to Egypt, and the Babylonian frontier pushed\\ndown to the ancient Egyptian boundaries.': 154, 'From 606 until 539 B.C.': 3, 'the Second Babylonian Empire flourished insecurely.': 17, 'It flourished so long as it kept the\\npeace with the stronger, hardier Median Empire to the north.': 286, 'And during these sixtyseven years not only life but\\nlearning flourished in the ancient city.': 552, 'Even under the Assyrian monarchs and especially under Sardanapalus, Babylon had been a scene of great\\nintellectual activity.': 527, 'Sardanapalus, though an Assyrian, had been quite Babylonized.': 83, 'He made a library, a library\\nnot of paper but of the clay tablets that were used for writing in Mesopotamia since early Sumerian days.': 454, 'His\\ncollection has been unearthed and is perhaps the most precious store of historical material in the world.': 547, 'The last of\\nthe Chaldean line of Babylonian monarchs, Nabonidus, had even keener literary tastes.': 224, 'He patronized antiquarian\\nresearches, and when a date was worked out by his investigators for the accession of Sargon I he commemorated\\nthe fact by inscriptions.': 52, 'But there were many signs of disunion in his empire, and he sought to centralize it by\\nbringing a number of the various local gods to Babylon and setting up temples to them there.': 538, 'This device was to\\nbe practised quite successfully by the Romans in later times, but in Babylon it roused the jealousy of the powerful\\npriesthood of Bel Marduk, the dominant god of the Babylonians.': 250, 'They cast about for a possible alternative to\\nNabonidus and found it in Cyrus the Persian, the ruler of the adjacent Median Empire.': 146, 'Cyrus had already\\ndistinguished himself by conquering Croesus, the rich king of Lydia in Eastern Asia Minor.': 200, 'He came up against\\nBabylon, there was a battle outside the walls, and the gates of the city were opened to him 538 B.C.. His soldiers\\nentered the city without fighting.': 470, 'The crown prince Belshazzar, the son of Nabonidus, was feasting, the Bible\\nrelates, when a hand appeared and wrote in letters of fire upon the wall these mystical words Mene, Mene,\\nTekel, Upharsin, which was interpreted by the prophet Daniel, whom he summoned to read the riddle, as GodA Short History of the World.': 497, 'The Last Babylonian Empire and the Empire of Darius I 33has numbered thy kingdom and finished it thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting and thy kingdom is\\ngiven to the Medes and Persians.': 251, 'Possibly the priests of Bel Marduk knew something about that writing on the\\nwall.': 124, 'Belshazzar was killed that night, says the Bible.': 41, 'Nabonidus was taken prisoner, and the occupation of the\\ncity was so peaceful that the services of Bel Marduk continued without intermission.': 177, 'Thus it was the Babylonian and Median empires were united.': 96, 'Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, subjugated Egypt.': 42, 'Cambyses went mad and was accidentally killed, and was presently succeeded by Darius the Mede, Darius I, the\\nson of Hystaspes, one of the chief councillors of Cyrus.': 479, 'The Persian Empire of Darius I, the first of the new Aryan empires in the seat of the old civilizations, was the\\ngreatest empire the world had hitherto seen.': 1464, 'It included all Asia Minor and Syria, all the old Assyrian and\\nBabylonian empires, Egypt, the Caucasus and Caspian regions, Media, Persia, and it extended into India as far as\\nthe Indus.': 287, 'Such an empire was possible because the horse and rider and the chariot and the maderoad had now\\nbeen brought into the world.': 813, 'Hitherto the ass and ox and the camel for desert use had afforded the swiftest method\\nof transport.': 91, 'Great arterial roads were made by the Persian rulers to hold their new empire, and post horses were\\nalways in waiting for the imperial messenger or the traveller with an official permit.': 799, 'Moreover the world was now\\nbeginning to use coined money, which greatly facilitated trade and intercourse.': 626, 'But the capital of this vast empire\\nwas no longer Babylon.': 312, 'In the long run the priesthood of Bel Marduk gained nothing by their treason.': 135, 'Babylon\\nthough still important was now a declining city, and the great cities of the new empire were Persepolis and Susa\\nand Ecbatana.': 1313, 'The capital was Susa.': 17, 'Nineveh was already abandoned and sinking into ruins.': 101, 'The Early History of the Jews\\nAND now we can tell of the Hebrews, a Semitic people, not so important in their own time as in their influence\\nupon the later history of the world.': 1615, 'They were settled in Judea long before 1000 B.C., and their capital city after\\nthat time was Jerusalem.': 415, 'Their story is interwoven with that of the great empires on either side of them, Egypt to\\nthe south and the changing empires of Syria, Assyria and Babylon to the north.': 808, 'Their country was an inevitable\\nhigh road between these latter powers and Egypt.': 160, 'Their importance in the world is due to the fact that they produced a written literature, a world history, a\\ncollection of laws, chronicles, psalms, books of wisdom, poetry and fiction and political utterances which became\\nat last what Christians know as the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible.': 1768, 'This literature appears in history in the\\nfourth or fifth century B.C.': 562, 'Probably this literature was first put together in Babylon.': 369, 'We have already told how the Pharaoh, Necho II,\\ninvaded the Assyrian Empire while Assyria was fighting for life against Medes, Persians and Chaldeans.': 367, 'Josiah\\nKing of Judah opposed him, and was defeated and slain at Megiddo 608 B.C.. Judah became a tributary to\\nEgypt, and when Nebuchadnezzar the Great, the new Chaldean king in Babylon, rolled back Necho into Egypt, he\\nattempted to manage Judah by setting up puppet kings in Jerusalem.': 622, 'The experiment failed, the people massacred\\nhis Babylonian officials, and he then determined to break up this little state altogether, which had long been\\nplaying off Egypt against the northern empire.': 860, 'Jerusalem was sacked and burnt, and the remnant of the people\\nwas carried off captive to Babylon.': 295, 'There they remained until Cyrus took Babylon 538 B.C..': 101, 'He then collected them together and sent them back to\\nresettle their country and rebuild the walls and temple of Jerusalem.': 230, 'Before that time the Jews do not seem to have been a

present Hebrew Bible, Chronicles, the Psalms and Proverbs\\nfor example.': 330, 'The accounts of the Creation of the World, of Adam and Eve and of the Flood, with which the Bible begins, run\\nclosely parallel with similar Babylonian legends they seem to have been part of the common beliefs of all the\\nSemetic peoples.': 386, 'So too the stories of Moses and of Samson have Sumerian and Babylonian parallels.': 12, 'But with\\nthe story of Abraham and onward begins something more special to the Jewish race.': 153, 'Abraham may have lived as early as the days of Hammurabi in Babylon.': 280, 'He was a patriarchal Semitic nomad.': 4, 'To\\nthe book of Genesis the reader must go for the story of his wanderings and for the stories of his sons and\\ngrandchildren and how they became captive in the Land of Egypt.': 300, 'He travelled through Canaan, and the God of\\nAbraham, says the Bible story, promised this smiling land of prosperous cities to him and to his children.': 246, 'And after a long sojourn in Egypt and after fifty years of wandering in the wilderness under the leadership of\\nMoses, the children of Abraham, grown now to a host of twelve tribes, invaded the land of Canaan

help out the story.': 270, 'But at any rate they did not succeed in\\nconquering any more than the hilly backgrounds of the promised land.': 102, 'The coast was now in the hands, not of the\\nCanaanites but of newcomers, those aegean peoples, the Philistines and their cities, Gaza, Gath, Ashdod, Ascalon\\nand Joppa successfully withstood the Hebrew attack.': 274, 'For many generations the children of Abraham remained an\\nobscure people of the hilly back country engaged in incessant bickerings with the Philistines and with the kindred\\ntribes about them, the Moabites, the Midianites and so forth.': 611, 'The reader will find in the book of Judges a record of\\ntheir struggles and disasters during this period.': 202, 'For very largely it is a record of disasters and

whose King\\nHiram seems to have been a man of very great intelligence and enterprise.': 799, 'He wished to secure a trade route to the\\nRed Sea through the Hebrew hill country.': 107, 'Normally Phoenician trade went to the Red Sea by Egypt, but Egypt\\nwas in a state of profound disorder at this time there may have been other obstructions to Phoenician trade along\\nthis line, and at any rate Hiram established the very closest relations both with David and with his son and\\nsuccessor Solomon.': 692, 'Under Hirams auspices the walls, palace and temple of Jerusalem arose, and in return Hiram\\nbuilt and launched his ships on the Red Sea.': 149, 'A very considerable trade passed northward and southward through\\nJerusalem.': 100, 'And Solomon achieved a prosperity and magnificence unprecedented in the experience of his people.': 276, 'He was even given a daughter of Pharaoh in marriage.': 121, 'But it is well to keep the proportion of things in mind.': 190, 'At the climax of his glories Solomon was only a little\\nsubordinate king in a little city.': 367, 'His power was so transitory that within a few years of his death, Shishak the first\\nPharaoh of the twentysecond

say that\\nit was added to and exaggerated by the patriotic pride of later writers.': 101, 'But the Bible account read carefully is not\\nso overwhelming as it appears at the first reading.': 318, 'Solomons temple, if one works out the measurements, would\\ngo inside a small suburban church, and his fourteen hundred chariots cease to impress us when we learn from an\\nAssyrian monument that his

be\\ndetails open to criticism in the Bible story of Hebrew history from the days of the Judges onward, but on the\\nwhole it is evidently a true story which squares with all that has been learnt in the excavation of Egypt and\\nAssyria and Babylon during the past century.': 989, 'It was in Babylon that the Hebrew people got their history together and evolved their tradition.': 625, 'The people who\\ncame back to Jerusalem at the command of Cyrus were a very different people in spirit and knowledge from those\\nwho had gone into captivity.': 863, 'They had learnt civilization.': 79, 'In the

from the barbaric beginnings of their people two great epics, the Iliad, telling how a\\nleague of Greek tribes besieged and took and sacked the town of Troy in Asia Minor, and the Odyssey, being a\\nlong adventure story of the return of the sage captain, Odysseus, from Troy to his own island.': 1264, 'These epics were\\nwritten down somewhen in the eighth or seventh century B.C., when the

particular blind bard, Homer, who was supposed to have sat down and\\ncomposed them as Milton composed Paradise Lost.': 39, 'Whether there really was such a poet, whether he composed\\nor only wrote down and polished these epics and so forth, is a favourite quarrelling ground for the erudite.': 79, 'We\\nneed not concern ourselves with such bickerings here.': 15, 'The thing that matters from our point of view is that the\\nGreeks were in possession of their epics in the eighth century B.C., and that they were a common possession and\\na link between their various tribes, giving them a sense of fellowship as against the outer barbarians.': 575, 'They were a\\ngroup of kindred peoples linked by the spoken and afterwards by the written word, and sharing common ideals of\\ncourage and behaviour.': 269, 'The epics showed the Greeks a barbaric people without iron, without writing, and still not living in cities.': 710, 'They\\nseem to have lived at first in open villages of huts around the halls of their chiefs outside the ruins of the aegean\\ncities they had destroyed.': 538, 'Then they began to wall their cities and to adopt the idea of temples from the people\\nthey had conquered.': 500, 'It has been said that the cities of the primitive civilizations grew up about the altar of some\\ntribal god, and that the wall was added in the cities of the Greeks the wall

mitigated something of the savagery of war between them, and a truce protected all\\ntravellers to and from the games.': 231, 'As time went on the sentiment of a common heritage grew and the number of\\nstates participating in the Olympic games increased until at last not only Greeks but competitors from the closely\\nkindred countries of Epirus and Macedonia to the north were admitted.': 827, 'The Greek cities grew in trade and importance, and the quality of their civilization rose steadily in the seventh and\\nsixth centuries B.C.': 392, 'Their social life differed in many interesting points from the social life of the aegean and river\\nvalley civilizations.': 832, 'They had splendid temples but the priesthood was not the great traditional body it was in the\\ncities of the older world, the repository of all knowledge, the storehouse of ideas.': 1209, 'They had leaders and noble\\nfamilies, but no quasidivine monarch surrounded by an elaborately organized court.': 114, 'Rather their organization\\nwas aristocratic, with leading families which kept each other in order.': 123, 'Even their socalled democracies were\\naristocratic every citizen had a share in public affairs and came to the assembly in a democracy, but everybody\\nwas not a citizen.': 352, 'The Greek democracies were not like our modern democracies in which everyone has a vote.': 190, 'Many of the Greek democracies had a few hundred or a few thousand citizens and then many thousands of slaves,\\nfreedmen and so forth, with no share in public affairs.': 352, 'Generally in Greece affairs were in the hands of a\\ncommunity of substantial men.': 292, 'Their kings and their tyrants alike were just men set in front of other men or\\nusurping a leadership they were not quasidivine overmen like Pharaoh or Minos or the monarchs of\\nMesopotamia.': 683, 'Both thought and government therefore had a freedom under Greek conditions such as they had\\nknown in none of the older civilizations.': 273, 'The Greeks had brought down into cities the individualism, the personal\\ninitiative of the wandering life of the northern parklands.': 404, 'They were the first republicans of importance in history.': 572, 'And we find that as they emerge from a condition of barbaric warfare a new thing becomes apparent in their\\nintellectual life.': 676, 'We find men who are not priests seeking and recording knowledge and enquiring into the\\nmysteries of life and being, in a way that has hitherto been the sublime privilege of priesthood or the\\npresumptuous amusement of kings.': 737, 'We find already in the sixth century B.C.perhaps while Isaiah was still\\nprophesying in Babylonsuch men as Thales and Anaximander of Miletus and Heraclitus of Ephesus, who were\\nwhat we should now call independent gentlemen, giving their minds to shrewd questionings of the world in which\\nwe live, asking what its real nature was, whence it came and what its destiny might be, and refusing all\\nreadymade or evasive answers.': 1548, 'Of these questionings of the universe by the Greek mind, we shall have more to\\nsay a little later in this history.': 552, 'These Greek enquirers who begin to be remarkable

'he met and smashed a vast conglomerate host under Darius III.': 75, 'Like the host of\\nXerxes that had crossed the Dardanelles a century and a half before, it was an incoherent accumulation of\\ncontingents and it was encumbered with a multitude of court officials, the harem of Darius and many camp\\nfollowers.': 477, 'Sidon surrendered to Alexander but Tyre resisted obstinately.': 10, 'Finally that great city was stormed and\\nplundered and destroyed.': 571, 'Gaza also was stormed, and towards the end of 332 B.C.': 223, 'the conqueror entered Egypt\\nand took over its rule from the Persians.': 98, 'At Alexandretta and at Alexandria in Egypt he built great cities, accessible from the land and so incapable of\\nrevolt.': 637, 'To these the trade of the Phoenician cities was diverted.': 107, 'The Phoenicians of the western Mediterranean\\nsuddenly disappear from historyand as immediately the Jews of Alexandria and the other new trading cities\\ncreated by Alexander appear.': 494, 'In 331 B.C.': 1, 'Alexander marched out of Egypt upon Babylon as Thothmes and Rameses and Necho had done\\nbefore him.': 326, 'But he marched by way of Tyre.': 83, 'At Arbela near the

Babylon and he died in 323 B.C.': 56, 'Immediately this vast dominion fell to pieces.': 113, 'One of his generals, Seleucus, retained most of the old Persian\\nempire from the Indus to Ephesus

raids\\nbegan from the north and grew in scope and intensity.': 223, 'Until at last, as we shall tell, a new power, the power of the\\nRoman republic, came out of the west to subjugate one fragment after another and weld them together into a new\\nand more enduring empire.': 1783, 'The Museum and Library at Alexandria\\nBEFORE the time of Alexander Greeks had already been spreading as merchants, artists, officials, mercenary\\nsoldiers, over most of the Persian dominions.': 346, 'In the dynastic disputes that followed the death of Xerxes, a band of\\nten thousand Greek mercenaries played a part under the leadership of Xenophon.': 264, 'Their return to Asiatic Greece\\nfrom Babylon is described in his Retreat of the Ten Thousand, one of the first war stories that was ever written by\\na general in command.': 780, 'But the conquests of Alexander and the division of his brief empire among his subordinate\\ngenerals, greatly stimulated this permeation of the ancient world by the Greeks and their language and fashions\\nand culture.': 978, 'Traces of this Greek dissemination are to be found far away in central Asia and in northwest India.': 289, 'Their influence upon the development of Indian art was profound.': 402, 'For many centuries Athens retained her prestige as a centre of art and culture her schools went on indeed to 529\\nA.D., that is to say for nearly a thousand years but the leadership in the intellectual activity of the world passed\\npresently across the Mediterranean to Alexandria, the new trading city that Alexander had founded.': 1680, 'Here the\\nMacedonian general Ptolemy had become Pharaoh, with a court that spoke Greek.': 131, 'He had become an intimate of\\nAlexander before he became king, and he was deeply saturated with the ideas of Aristotle.': 322, 'He set himself, with\\ngreat energy and capacity, to organize knowledge and investigation.': 606, 'He also wrote a history of Alexanders\\ncampaigns which, unhappily, is lost to the world.': 902, 'Alexander had already devoted considerable sums to finance the enquiries of Aristotle, but Ptolemy I was the first\\nperson to make a permanent endowment of science.': 516, 'He set up a foundation in Alexandria which was formerly\\ndedicated to the Muses, the Museum of Alexandria.': 83, 'For two or three generations the scientific work done at\\nAlexandria was extraordinarily good.': 327, 'Euclid, Eratosthenes who measured the size of the earth and came within\\nfifty miles of its true diameter, Apollonius who wrote on conic sections, Hipparchus who made the first star map\\nand catalogue, and Hero who devised the first steam engine are among the greater stars of an extraordinary\\nconstellation of scientific pioneers.': 1291, 'Archimedes came from Syracuse to Alexandria to study, and was a frequent\\ncorrespondent of the Museum.': 166, 'Herophilus was one of the greatest of Greek anatomists, and is said to have\\npractised vivisection.': 294, 'For a generation or so during the reigns of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II there was such a blaze of knowledge and\\ndiscovery at Alexandria as the world was not to see again until the sixteenth century A.D.': 803, 'But it did not continue.': 4, 'There may have been several causes of this decline.': 126, 'Chief among them, the late Professor Mahaffy suggested, was\\nthe fact that the Museum was a royal college and all its professors and fellows were appointed and paid byA Short History of the World.': 137, 'This was all very well when Pharaoh was Ptolemy I, the pupil and friend of Aristotle.': 35, 'But as the dynasty\\nof the Ptolemies went on they became Egyptianized, they fell under the sway of Egyptian priests and Egyptian\\nreligious developments, they ceased to follow the work that was done, and their control stifled the spirit of\\nenquiry altogether.': 624, 'The Museum produced little good work after its first century of activity.': 691, 'Ptolemy I not only sought in the most modern spirit to organize the finding of fresh knowledge.': 203, 'He tried also to\\nset up an encyclopaedic storehouse of wisdom in the Library of Alexandria.': 209, 'It was not simply a storehouse, it was\\nalso a bookcopying and bookselling organization.': 145, 'A great army of copyists was set to work perpetually\\nmultiplying copies of books.': 664, 'Here then we have the definite first opening up of the intellectual process in which we live today here we have\\nthe systematic gathering and distribution of knowledge.': 525, 'The foundation of this Museum and Library marks one of\\nthe great epochs in the history of mankind.': 1044, 'It is the true beginning of Modern History.': 76, 'BOTH the work of research and the work of dissemination went on under serious handicaps.': 228, 'One of these was the\\ngreat social gap that separated the philosopher, who was a gentleman, from the trader and the artisan.': 551, 'There were\\nglass workers and metal workers in abundance in those days, but they were not in mental contact with the\\nthinkers.': 161, 'The glass worker was making the most beautifully coloured beads and phials and so forth, but he never\\nmade a Florentine flask or a lens.': 316, 'Clear glass does not seem to have interested him.': 64, 'The metal worker made\\nweapons and jewellery but he never made a chemical balance.': 465, 'The philosopher speculated loftily about atoms and\\nthe nature of things, but he had no practical experience of enamels and pigments and philters and so forth.': 147, 'He was\\nnot interested in substances.': 9, 'So Alexandria in its brief day of opportunity produced no microscopes and no\\nchemistry.': 79, 'And though Hero invented a steam engine it was never set either to pump or drive a boat or do any\\nuseful thing.': 301, 'There were few practical applications of science except in the realm of medicine, and the progress of\\nscience was not stimulated and sustained by the interest and excitement of practical applications.': 236, 'There was\\nnothing to keep the work going therefore when the intellectual curiosity of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II was\\nwithdrawn.': 197, 'The discoveries of the Museum went on record in obscure manuscripts and never, until the revival of\\nscientific curiosity at the Renascence, reached out to the mass of mankind.': 375, 'Nor did the Library produce any improvements in book making.': 52, 'That ancient world had no paper made in definite\\nsizes from rag pulp.': 742, 'Paper was a Chinese invention and it did not reach the western world until the ninth century\\nA.D.': 780, 'The only book materials were parchment and strips of the papyrus reed joined edge to edge.': 50, 'These strips\\nwere kept on rolls which were very unwieldy to wind to and fro and read, and very inconvenient for reference.': 66, 'It\\nwas these things that prevented the development of paged and printed books.': 186, 'Printing itself was known in the\\nworld it would seem as early as the Old Stone Age there were seals in ancient Sumeria but without abundant\\npaper there was little advantage in printing books, an improvement that may further have been resisted by trades\\nunionism on the part of the copyists employed.': 1275, 'Alexandria produced abundant books but not cheap books, and it\\nnever spread knowledge into the population of the ancient world below the level of a wealthy and influential\\nclass.': 899, 'So it was that this blaze of intellectual enterprise never reached beyond a small circle of people in touch with the\\ngroup of philosophers collected by the first two Ptolemies.': 927, 'It was like the light in a dark lantern which is shut off\\nfrom the world at large.': 657, 'Within the blaze may be blindingly bright, but nevertheless it is unseen.': 123, 'The rest of the\\nworld went on its old ways unaware that the seed of scientific knowledge that was one day to revolutionize it\\naltogether had been sown.': 1115, 'Presently a darkness of bigotry fell even upon Alexandria.': 421, 'Thereafter for a thousand\\nyears of darkness the seed that Aristotle had sown lay hidden.': 261, 'Then it stirred and began to germinate.': 82, 'In a few\\ncenturies it had become that widespread growth of knowledge and clear ideas that is now changing the whole of\\nhuman life.': 739, 'Alexandria was not the only centre of Greek intellectual activity in the third century B.C.': 312, 'There were many other\\ncities that displayed a brilliant intellectual life amidst the disintegrating fragments of the brief empire ofA Short History of the World.': 713, 'There was, for example, the Greek city of Syracuse in Sicily, where thought and science flourished for\\ntwo centuries there was Pergamum in Asia Minor, which also had a great library.': 986, 'But this brilliant Hellenic world\\nwas now stricken by invasion from the north.': 589, 'New Nordic barbarians, the Gauls, were striking down along the\\ntracks that had once been followed by the ancestors of the Greeks and Phrygians and Macedonians.': 115, 'They raided,\\nshattered and destroyed.': 51, 'And in the wake of the Gauls came a new conquering people out of Italy, the Romans,\\nwho gradually subjugated all the western half of the vast realm of Darius and Alexander.': 858, 'They were an able but\\nunimaginative people, preferring law and profit to either science of art.': 379, 'New invaders were also coming down out\\nof central Asia to shatter and subdue the Seleucid empire and to cut off the western world again from India.': 979, 'These\\nwere the Parthians, hosts of mounted bowmen, who treated the GraecoPersian empire of Persepolis and Susa in\\nthe third century B.C.': 486, 'in much the same fashion that the Medes and Persians had treated it in the seventh and\\nsixth.': 196, 'And there were now other nomadic peoples also coming out of the northeast, peoples who were not fair\\nand Nordic and Aryanspeaking but yellowskinned and blackhaired and with a Mongolian speech.': 385, 'But of these\\nlatter people we shall tell more in a subsequent chapter.': 318, 'The Life of Gautama Buddha\\nBUT now we must go back three centuries in our story to tell of a great teacher who came near to revolutionizing\\nthe religious thought and feeling of all Asia.': 1066, 'This was Gautama Buddha, who taught his disciples at Benares in\\nIndia about the same time that Isaiah was prophesying among the Jews in Babylon and Heraclitus was carrying on\\nhis speculative enquiries into the nature of things at Ephesus.': 409, 'All these men were in the world at the same time, in\\nthe sixth century B.C.unaware of one another.': 1410, 'The sixth century B.C.': 232, 'was indeed one of the most remarkable in all history.': 578, 'Everywherefor as we shall tell it\\nwas also the case in Chinamens minds were displaying a new boldness.': 478, 'Everywhere they were waking up out of\\nthe traditions of kingships and priests and blood sacrifices and asking the most penetrating questions.': 122, 'It is as if the\\nrace had reached a stage of adolescenceafter a childhood of twenty thousand years.': 336, 'The early history of India is still very obscure.': 530, 'Somewhen perhaps about 2000 B.C., an Aryanspeaking people\\ncame down from the northwest into India either in one invasion or in a series of invasions and was able to\\nspread its language and traditions over most of north India.': 961, 'Its peculiar variety of Aryan speech was the Sanskrit.': 45, 'They found a brunette people with a more elaborate civilization and less vigour of will, in possession of the\\ncountry of the Indus and Ganges.': 511, 'But they do not seem to have mingled with their predecessors as freely as did\\nthe Greeks and Persians.': 66, 'They remained aloof.': 57, 'When the past of India becomes dimly visible to the historian,\\nIndian society is already stratified into several layers, with a variable number of subdivisions, which do not eat\\ntogether nor intermarry nor associate freely.': 278, 'And throughout history this stratification into castes continues.': 340, 'This\\nmakes the Indian population something different from the simple, freely interbreeding European or Mongolian\\ncommunities.': 183, 'It is really a community of communities.': 56, 'Siddhattha Gautama was the son of an aristocratic family which ruled a small district on the Himalayan slopes.': 153, 'He\\nwas married at nineteen to a beautiful cousin.': 24, 'He hunted and played and went about in his sunny world of gardens\\nand groves and irrigated ricefields.': 599, 'And it was amidst this life that a great discontent fell upon him.': 1006, 'It was the\\nunhappiness of a fine brain that seeks employment.': 30, 'He felt that the existence he was leading was not the reality of\\nlife, but a holidaya holiday that had gone on too long.': 390, 'The sense of disease and mortality, the insecurity and the unsatisfactoriness of all happiness, descended upon the\\nmind of Gautama.': 391, 'While he was in this mood he met one of those wandering ascetics who already existed in great\\nnumbers in India.': 801, 'These men lived under severe rules, spending

History of the World.': 336, 'The Life of Gautama Buddha 46He was meditating upon this project, says the story, when the news was brought to him that his wife had been\\ndelivered of his firstborn son.': 437, 'This is another tie to break, said Gautama.': 111, 'He returned to the village amidst the rejoicings of his fellow clansmen.': 38, 'There was a great feast and a Nautch\\ndance to celebrate the birth of his new tie, and in the night Gautama awoke in a great agony of spirit, like a man\\nwho is told that his house is on fire.': 1570, 'He resolved to leave his happy aimless life forthwith.': 246, 'He went softly to the\\nthreshold of his wifes chamber, and saw her by the light of a little oil lamp, sleeping sweetly, surrounded by\\nflowers, with his infant son in her arms.': 280, 'He felt a great craving to take up the child in one first and last embrace\\nbefore he departed, but the fear of waking his wife prevented him, and at last he turned away and went out into\\nthe bright Indian moonshine and mounted his horse and rode off into the world.': 1888, 'Very far he rode that night, and in the morning he stopped outside the lands of his clan, and dismounted beside a\\nsandy river.': 203, 'There he cut off his flowing locks with his sword, removed all his ornaments and sent them and his\\nhorse and sword back to his house.': 132, 'Going on he presently met a ragged man and exchanged clothes with him, and\\nso having divested himself of all worldly entanglements he was free to pursue his search after wisdom.': 304, 'He made\\nhis way southward to a resort of hermits and teachers in a hilly spur of the Vindhya Mountains.': 284, 'There lived a\\nnumber of wise men in a warren of caves, going into the town for their simple supplies and imparting their\\nknowledge by word of mouth to such as cared to come to them.': 477, 'Gautama became versed in all the metaphysics of\\nhis age.': 236, 'But his acute intelligence was dissatisfied with the solutions offered him.': 33, 'The Indian mind has always been disposed to believe that power and knowledge may be obtained by extreme\\nasceticism, by fasting, sleeplessness, and selftorment, and these ideas Gautama now put to the test.': 527, 'He betook\\nhimself with five disciple companions to the jungle and there he gave himself up to fasting and terrible penances.': 81, 'His fame spread, like the sound of a great bell hung in the canopy of the skies.': 643, 'But it brought him no sense of\\ntruth achieved.': 79, 'One day he was walking up and down, trying to think in spite of his enfeebled state.': 156, 'Suddenly he\\nfell unconscious.': 39, 'When he recovered, the preposterousness of these semimagical ways to wisdom was plain to\\nhim.': 42, 'He horrified his companions by demanding ordinary food and refusing to continue his mortifications.': 56, 'He had\\nrealized that whatever truth a man may reach is reached best by a nourished brain in a healthy body.': 381, 'Such a\\nconception was absolutely foreign to the ideas of the land and age.': 309, 'His disciples deserted him, and went off in a\\nmelancholy state to Benares.': 184, 'Gautama wandered alone.': 13, 'When the mind grapples with a great and intricate problem, it makes its advances step by step, with but little\\nrealization of the gains it has made, until suddenly, with an effect of abrupt illumination, it realizes its victory.': 893, 'So\\nit happened to Gautama.': 8, 'He had seated himself under a great tree by the side of a river to eat, when this sense of\\nclear version came to him.': 709, 'It seemed to him that he saw life plain.': 290, 'He is said to have sat all day and all night in\\nprofound thought, and then he rose up to impart his vision to the world.': 645, 'He went on to Benares and there he sought out and won back his lost disciples to his new teaching.': 500, 'In the Kings\\nDeer Park at Benares they built themselves huts and set up a sort of school to which came many who were\\nseeking after wisdom.': 437, 'The starting point of his teaching was his own question as a fortunate young man, Why am I not completely\\nhappy It was an introspective question.': 324, 'It was a question very different in quality from the frank and\\nselfforgetful externalized curiosity with which Thales and Heraclitus were attacking the problems of the\\nuniverse, or the equally selfforgetful burthen of moral obligation that the culminating prophets were imposing\\nupon the Hebrew mind.': 532, 'The Indian teacher did not forget self, he concentrated upon self and sought to destroy it.': 334, 'All suffering, he taught, was due to the greedy desires of the individual.': 63, 'Until man has conquered his personal\\ncravings his life is trouble and his end sorrow.': 523, 'There were three principal forms that the craving for life took and\\nthey were all evil.': 346, 'The first was the desire of the appetites, greed and all forms of sensuousness, the second wasA Short History of the World.': 352, 'The Life of Gautama Buddha 47the desire for a personal and egotistic immortality, the third was the craving for personal success, worldliness,\\navarice and the like.': 232, 'All these forms of desire had to be overcome to escape from the distresses and chagrins of\\nlife.': 275, 'When they were overcome, when self had vanished altogether, then serenity of soul, Nirvana, the highest\\ngood was attained.': 117, 'This was the gist of his teaching, a very subtle and metaphysical teaching indeed, not nearly so easy to understand\\nas the Greek injunction to see and know fearlessly and rightly and the Hebrew command to fear God and\\naccomplish righteousness.': 296, 'It was a teaching much beyond the understanding of even Gautamas immediate\\ndisciples, and it is no wonder that so soon as his personal influence was withdrawn it became corrupted and\\ncoarsened.': 536, 'There was a widespread belief in India at that time that at long intervals Wisdom came to earth and\\nwas incarnate in some chosen person who was known as the Buddha.': 561, 'Gautamas disciples declared that he was a\\nBuddha, the latest of the Buddhas, though there is no evidence that he himself ever accepted the title.': 118, 'Before he\\nwas well dead, a cycle of fantastic legends began to be woven about him.': 151, 'The human heart was always preferred a\\nwonder story to a moral effort, and Gautama Buddha became very wonderful.': 384, 'Yet there remained a substantial gain in the world.': 538, 'If Nirvana was too high and subtle for most mens\\nimaginations, if the mythmaking impulse in the race was too strong for the simple facts of Gautamas life, they\\ncould at least grasp something of the intention of what Gautama called the Eightfold way, the Aryan or Noble\\nPath in life.': 872, 'In this there was an insistence upon mental uprightness, upon right aims and speech, right conduct\\nand honest livelihood.': 656, 'There was a quickening of the conscience and an appeal to generous and selfforgetful\\nends.': 33, 'King Asoka\\nFOR some generations after the death of Gautama, these high and noble Buddhist teachings, this first plain\\nteaching that the highest good for man is the subjugation of self, made comparatively little headway in the world.': 1396, 'Then they conquered the imagination of one of the greatest monarchs the world has ever seen.': 852, 'We have already mentioned how Alexander the Great came down into India and fought with Porus upon the\\nIndus.': 547, 'It is related by the Greek historians that a certain

and divided and combined and\\nrecombined, just as the Nordic peoples in north Europe and central Asia changed and varied in name rather than\\nin nature.': 400, 'These Mongolian nomads had horses earlier than the Nordic peoples, and it may be that in the region of\\nthe Altai Mountains they made an independent discovery of iron somewhen after 1000 B.C.': 541, 'And just as in the\\nwestern case so ever and again these eastern nomads would achieve a sort of political unity, and become the\\nconquerors and masters and revivers of this or that settled and civilized region.': 665, 'It is quite possible that the earliest civilization of China was not Mongolian at all any more than the earliest\\ncivilization of Europe and western Asia was Nordic or Semitic.': 321, 'It is quite possible that the earliest civilization of\\nChina was a brunette civilization and of a piece with the earliest Egyptian, Sumerian and Dravidian civilizations,\\nand that when the first recorded history of China began there had already been conquests and intermixture.': 1044, 'At any\\nrate we find that by 1750 B.C.': 54, 'China was already a vast system of little kingdoms and city states, all\\nacknowledging a loose allegiance and paying more or less regularly, more or less definite feudal dues to one great\\npriest emperor, the Son of Heaven.': 1357, 'The Shang dynasty came to an end in 1125 B.C.': 256, 'A Chow dynasty\\nsucceeded Shang, and maintained China in a relaxing unity until the days of Asoka in India and of the Ptolemies\\nin Egypt.': 148, 'Gradually China went to pieces during that long Chow period.': 249, 'Hunnish peoples came down and set up\\nprincipalities local rulers discontinued their tribute and became independent.': 508, 'There was in the sixth century B.C.,\\nsays one Chinese authority, five or six thousand practically independent states in China.': 717, 'It was what the Chinese\\ncall in their records an Age of Confusion.A Short History of the World.': 30, 'Confucius and Lao Tse 49But this Age of Confusion was compatible with much intellectual activity and with the existence of many local\\ncentres of art and civilized living.': 431, 'When we know more of Chinese history we shall find that China also had her\\nMiletus and her Athens, her Pergamum and her Macedonia.': 486, 'At present we must be vague and brief about this\\nperiod of Chinese division simply because our knowledge is not sufficient for us to frame a coherent and\\nconsecutive story.': 356, 'And just as in divided Greece there were philosophers and in shattered and captive Jewry prophets, so in\\ndisordered China there were philosophers and teachers at this time.': 292, 'In all these cases insecurity and uncertainty\\nseemed to have quickened the better sort of mind.': 202, 'Confucius was a man of aristocratic origin and some official\\nimportance in a small state called Lu.': 412, 'Here in a very parallel mood to the Greek impulse he set up a sort of\\nAcademy for discovering and teaching Wisdom.': 211, 'The lawlessness and disorder of China distressed him\\nprofoundly.': 22, 'He conceived an ideal of a better government and a better life, and travelled from state to state\\nseeking a prince who would carry out his legislative and educational ideas.': 798, 'He never found his prince he found a\\nprince, but court intrigues undermined the influence of the teacher and finally defeated his reforming proposals.': 411, 'It\\nis interesting to note that a century and a half later the Greek philosopher Plato also sought a prince, and was for a\\ntime adviser to the tyrant Dionysius who ruled Syracuse in Sicily.': 732, 'Confucius died a disappointed man.': 201, 'No intelligent ruler arises to take me as his master, he said, and my time\\nhas come to die.': 356, 'But his teaching had more vitality than he imagined in his declining and hopeless years, and it\\nbecame a great formative influence with the Chinese people.': 1032, 'It became one of what the Chinese call the Three\\nTeachings, the other two being those of Buddha and of Lao Tse.': 486, 'The gist of the teaching of Confucius was the way of the noble or aristocratic man.': 310, 'He was concerned with\\npersonal conduct as much as Gautama was concerned with the peace of selfforgetfulness and the Greek with\\nexternal knowledge and the Jew with righteousness.': 315, 'He was the most publicminded of all great teachers.': 454, 'He was\\nsupremely concerned by the confusion and miseries of the world, and he wanted to make men noble in order to\\nbring about a noble world.': 1320, 'He sought to regulate conduct to an extraordinary extent to provide sound rules for\\nevery occasion in life.': 357, 'A polite, publicspirited gentleman, rather sternly selfdisciplined, was the ideal he found\\nalready developing in the northern Chinese world and one to which he gave a permanent form.': 1041, 'The teaching of Lao Tse, who was for a long time in charge of the imperial library of the Chow dynasty, was\\nmuch more mystical and vague and elusive than that of Confucius.': 565, 'He seems to have preached a stoical\\nindifference to the pleasures and powers of the world and a return to an imaginary simple life of the past.': 844, 'He left\\nwritings very contracted in style and very obscure.': 62, 'He wrote in riddles.': 15, 'After his death his teachings, like the\\nteachings of Gautama Buddha, were corrupted and overlaid by legends and had the most complex and\\nextraordinary observances and superstitious ideas grafted upon them.': 589, 'In China just as in India primordial ideas of\\nmagic and monstrous legends out of the childish past of our race struggled against the new thinking in the world\\nand succeeded in plastering it over with grotesque, irrational and antiquated observances.': 963, 'Both Buddhism and\\nTaoism which ascribes itself largely to Lao Tse as one finds them in China now, are religions of monk, temple,\\npriest and offering of a type as ancient in form, if not in thought, as the sacrificial religions of ancient Sumeria and\\nEgypt.': 603, 'But the teaching of Confucius was not so overlaid because it was limited and plain and straightforward and\\nlent itself to no such distortions.': 82, 'North China, the China of the Hwangho River, became Confucian in thought and spirit south China,\\nYangtseKiang China, became Taoist.': 379, 'Since those days a conflict has always been traceable in Chinese affairs\\nbetween these two spirits, the spirit of the north and the spirit of the south, between in latter times Pekin and\\nNankin, between the officialminded, upright and conservative north, and the sceptical, artistic, lax and\\nexperimental south.': 764, 'The divisions of China of the Age of Confusion reached their worst stage in the sixth century B.C.': 303, 'The Chow\\ndynasty was so enfeebled and so discredited that Lao Tse left the unhappy court and retired into private life.A Short History of the World.': 147, 'Confucius and Lao Tse 50Three nominally subordinate powers dominated the situation in those days, Tsi and Tsin, both northern powers,\\nand Chu, which was an aggressive military power in the Yangtse valley.': 399, 'At last Tsi and Tsin formed an alliance,\\nsubdued Chu and imposed a general treaty of disarmament and peace in China.': 241, 'The power of Tsin became\\npredominant.': 244, 'Finally about the time of Asoka in India the Tsin monarch seized upon the sacrificial vessels of the\\nChow emperor and took over his sacrificial duties.': 681, 'His son, ShiHwangti king in 246 B.C., emperor in 220\\nB.C., is called in the Chinese Chronicles the First Universal Emperor.': 259, 'More fortunate than Alexander, ShiHwangti reigned for thirtysix years as king and emperor.': 351, 'His energetic\\nreign marks the beginning of a new era of unity and prosperity for the Chinese people.': 601, 'He fought vigorously\\nagainst the Hunnish invaders from the northern deserts, and he began that immense work, the Great Wall of\\nChina, to set a limit to their incursions.': 303, 'Rome Comes into History\\nTHE READER will note a general similarity in the history of all these civilizations in spite of the effectual\\nseparation caused by the great barriers of the Indian northwest frontier and of the mountain masses of Central\\nAsia and further India.': 934, 'First for thousands of years the heliolithic culture spread over all the warm and fertile river\\nvalleys of the old world and developed a temple system and priest rulers about its sacrificial traditions.': 1046, 'Apparently its first makers were always those brunette peoples we have spoken of as the central race of mankind.': 546, 'Then the nomads came in from the regions of seasonal grass and seasonal migrations and superposed their own\\ncharacteristics and often their own language on the primitive civilization.': 389, 'They subjugated and stimulated it, and\\nwere stimulated to fresh developments

innovation.': 648, 'They questioned the beliefs of immemorial\\nages.': 38, 'They let daylight into the temples.': 42, 'They set up kings who were neither priests nor gods but mere leaders\\namong their captains and companions.': 327, 'In the centuries following the sixth century B.C.': 329, 'we find everywhere a great breaking down of ancient traditions\\nand a new spirit of moral and intellectual enquiry awake, a spirit never more to be altogether stilled in the great\\nprogressive movement of mankind.': 1652, 'We find reading and writing becoming common and accessible\\naccomplishments among the ruling and prosperous minority they were no longer the jealously guarded secret of\\nthe priests.': 373, 'Travel is increasing and transport growing easier by

world to the western half of the\\nMediterranean.': 843, 'Here we have to note the appearance of a city which was destined to play at last a very great part\\nindeed in human affairs, Rome.': 962, 'Hitherto we have told very little about Italy in our story.': 163, 'It was before 1000 B.C.': 12, 'a land of mountain and forest\\nand thinly populated.': 103, 'Aryanspeaking tribes had pressed down this peninsula and formed little towns and cities,\\nand the southern extremity was studded with Greek settlements.': 283, 'The noble ruins of Paestum preserve for us to this\\nday something of the

aristocratic republic with a lordly class of patrician families dominating a commonalty of plebeians.': 205, 'Except\\nthat it spoke Latin it was not unlike many aristocratic Greek republics.': 144, 'For some centuries the internal history of Rome was the story of a long and obstinate struggle for freedom and a\\nshare in the government on the part of the plebeians.': 716, 'It would not be difficult to find Greek parallels to this\\nconflict, which the Greeks would have called a conflict of aristocracy with democracy.': 528, 'In the end the plebeians\\nbroke down most of the exclusive

the\\ninclusion of more and more outsiders.': 364, 'For while she still struggled at home, she was extending her power\\nabroad.': 340, 'The extension of Roman power began in the fifth century B.C.': 449, 'Until that time they had waged war, and generally\\nunsuccessful war, with the Etruscans.': 491, 'There was an Etruscan fort, Veii, only a few miles from Rome which the\\nRomans had never been

was hitherto an unheardof size, quinqueremes,\\ngalleys with five banks of oars and a huge ram.': 598, 'At the battle of Salamis, two centuries before, the leading\\nbattleships had only been triremes with three banks.': 302, 'But the Romans, with extraordinary energy and in spite of the\\nfact that they had little naval experience, set themselves to outbuild the Carthaginians.': 267, 'They manned the new navy\\nthey created chiefly with Greek seamen, and they invented grappling and boarding to make up for the superior\\nseamanship of the enemy.': 375, 'When the Carthaginian came up to ram or

'She made Egypt, still under the Ptolemies, and Pergamum and most of the small states of Asia\\nMinor into Allies, or, as we should call them now, protected states.': 630, 'Meanwhile Carthage,

Semitic states and cities that had flourished in the world five centuries\\nbefore only one little country remained free under native rulers.': 1293, 'This was Judea, which had liberated itself from\\nthe Seleucids and was under the rule of the native Maccabean princes.': 101, 'By this time it had its Bible almost\\ncomplete, and was developing the distinctive traditions of the Jewish world as we know it now.': 801, 'It was natural that\\nthe Carthaginians, Phoenicians and kindred peoples dispersed about the world should find a common link in their\\npractically identical language and in this literature of hope and courage.': 848, 'To a large extent they were still the\\ntraders and bankers of the world.': 681, 'The Semitic world had been submerged rather than replaced.': 535, 'Jerusalem, which has always been rather the symbol than the centre of Judaism, was taken by the Romans in 65\\nB.C.': 108, 'and after various vicissitudes of quasiindependence and revolt was besieged

Roman Empire\\nNOW this new Roman power which arose to dominate the western world in the second and first centuries B.C.': 1356, 'was in several respects a different thing from any of the great empires that had hitherto prevailed in the civilized\\nworld.': 1147, 'It was not at first a monarchy, and it was not the creation of any one great conqueror.': 995, 'It was not indeed the\\nfirst of

Roman Empire 54went on to fresh developments.': 36, 'The centre of this new system lay far to the west of the more ancient centres of empire, which had hitherto been\\nthe river valleys of Mesopotamia and Egypt.': 849, 'This westward position enabled Rome to bring in to civilization\\nquite fresh regions and peoples.': 302, 'The Roman power extended to Morocco and Spain, and was presently able to\\nthrust northwestward over what is now France and Belgium to Britain and northeastward into Hungary and\\nSouth Russia.': 249, 'But on the other hand it was never able to maintain itself in Central Asia or Persia because they\\nwere too far from its administrative centres.': 247, 'It included therefore great masses of fresh Nordic Aryanspeaking\\npeoples, it presently incorporated nearly all the Greek people in the world, and its population was less strongly\\nHamitic and Semitic than that of any preceding empire.': 1721, 'For some centuries this Roman Empire did not fall into the grooves of precedent that had so speedily swallowed\\nup Persian and Greek, and all that time it developed.': 350, 'The rulers of the Medes and Persians became entirely\\nBabylonized in a generation or so they took over the tiara of the king of kings and the temples and priesthoods of\\nhis gods Alexander and his successors followed in the same easy path of assimilation the Seleucid monarchs had\\nmuch the same court and administrative methods as Nebuchadnezzar the Ptolemies became Pharaohs and\\naltogether Egyptian.': 823, 'They were assimilated just as before them the Semitic conquerors of the Sumerians had been\\nassimilated.': 38, 'But the Romans ruled in their own city, and for some centuries kept to the laws of their own nature.': 244, 'The only people who exercised any great mental influence upon them before the second or third century A.D.\\nwere the kindred and similar Greeks.': 1333, 'So that the Roman Empire was essentially a first attempt to rule a great\\ndominion upon mainly Aryan lines.': 1097, 'It was so far a new pattern in history, it was an expanded Aryan republic.': 714, 'The\\nold pattern of a personal conqueror ruling over a capital city that had grown up round the temple of a harvest god\\ndid not apply to it.': 399, 'The Romans had gods and temples, but like the gods of the Greeks their gods were\\nquasihuman immortals, divine patricians.': 277, 'The Romans also had blood sacrifices and even made human ones in\\ntimes of stress, things they may have learnt to do from their dusky Etruscan teachers but until Rome was long\\npast its zenith neither priest nor temple played a large part in Roman history.': 1412, 'The Roman Empire was a growth, an unplanned novel growth the Roman people found themselves engaged\\nalmost unawares in a vast administrative experiment.': 479, 'It cannot be called a successful experiment.': 78, 'In the end their\\nempire collapsed altogether.': 341, 'And it changed enormously in form and method from century to century.': 491, 'It changed\\nmore in a hundred years than Bengal or Mesopotamia or Egypt changed in a thousand.': 291, 'It was always changing.': 28, 'It\\nnever attained to any fixity.': 76, 'In a sense the experiment failed.': 46, 'In a sense the experiment remains unfinished, and Europe and America today\\nare still working out the riddles of worldwide statescraft first confronted by the Roman people.': 801, 'It is well for the student of history to bear in mind the very great changes not only in political but in social and\\nmoral matters that went on throughout the period of Roman

390 B.C.': 373, 'and went on until the end of the First Punic War 240 B.C.. We may call this\\nstage the stage of the Assimilative Republic.': 334, 'It was perhaps the finest, most characteristic stage in Roman history.': 353, 'The agelong dissensions of patrician and plebeian were drawing to a close, the Etruscan threat had come to an\\nend, no one was very rich yet nor very poor, and most men were publicspirited.': 685, 'It was a republic like the\\nrepublic of

coalescence.': 191, 'Her centuries\\nof civil dissension had trained her people in compromise and concessions.': 343, 'Some of the defeated cities became\\naltogether Roman with a voting share in the

given citizenship the right, if he could get there, to vote in the town meeting in Rome.': 679, 'This extension of citizenship to tractable cities and to whole countries was the distinctive device of Roman\\nexpansion.': 212, 'It reversed the old process of conquest and assimilation altogether.': 190, 'By the Roman method the\\nconquerors assimilated the conquered.': 86, 'But after the First Punic War and the annexation of Sicily, though the old process of assimilation still went on,\\nanother process arose by its side.': 546, 'Sicily for instance was treated as a conquered prey.': 59, 'It was declared an estate\\nof the Roman people.': 252, 'Its rich soil and industrious population was exploited to make Rome rich.': 167, 'The patricians\\nand the more influential among the plebeians secured the major share of that wealth.': 117, 'And the war also brought in\\na large supply of slaves.': 361, 'Before the First Punic War the population of the republic had been largely a population\\nof citizen farmers.': 198, 'Military service was their privilege and liability.': 20, 'While they were on active service their farms\\nfell into debt and a new largescale slave agriculture grew up when they returned they found their produce in\\ncompetition with slavegrown produce from Sicily and from the new estates at home.': 833, 'Times had changed.': 19, 'The\\nrepublic had altered its character.': 61, 'Not only was Sicily in the hands of Rome, the common man was in the hands of\\nthe rich creditor and the rich competitor.': 353, 'Rome had entered upon its second

had enjoyed their privileges.': 713, 'The First Punic War wasted them and robbed\\nthem of all they had won.': 13, 'The value of their electoral privileges had also evaporated.': 121, 'The governing bodies of the Roman republic were two\\nin number.': 223, 'The first and more important was the Senate.': 287, 'This was a body originally of patricians and then of\\nprominent men of all sorts, who were summoned to it first by certain powerful officials, the consuls and censors.': 580, 'Like the British House of Lords it became a gathering of great landowners, prominent politicians, big business\\nmen and the like.': 939, 'It was much more like the British House of Lords than it was like the American Senate.': 388, 'For\\nthree centuries, from the Punic Wars onward, it was the centre of Roman political thought and purpose.': 336, 'The\\nsecond body was the Popular Assembly.': 63, 'This was supposed to be an assembly of all the citizens of Rome.': 42, 'When\\nRome was a little state twenty miles square this was a possible gathering.': 272, 'When the citizenship of Rome had\\nspread beyond the confines in Italy, it was an altogether impossible one.': 399, 'Its meetings, proclaimed by\\nhornblowing from the Capitol and the city walls, became more and more a gathering of political hacks and city\\nriffraff.': 409, 'In the fourth century B.C.': 227, 'the Popular Assembly was a considerable check upon the Senate, a competent\\nrepresentation of the claims and rights of the common man.': 573, 'By the end of the Punic Wars it was an impotent relic\\nof a vanquished popular control.': 117, 'No effectual legal check remained upon the big men.': 571, 'Nothing of the nature of representative government was ever introduced into the Roman republic.': 160, 'No one thought\\nof electing delegates to represent the will of the citizens.': 308, 'This is a very important point for the student to grasp.': 52, 'The Popular Assembly never became the equivalent of the American House of Representatives or the British\\nHouse of Commons.': 178, 'In theory it was all the citizens in practice it ceased to be anything at all worth\\nconsideration.A Short History of the World.': 54, 'The Growth of the Roman Empire 56The common citizen of the Roman Empire was therefore in a very poor case after the Second Punic War he was\\nimpoverished, he had often lost his farm, he was ousted from profitable production by slaves, and he had no\\npolitical power left to him to remedy these things.': 574, 'The only methods of popular expression left to a people\\nwithout any form of political expression are the strike and the revolt.': 535, 'The story of the second and first centuries\\nB.C., so far as internal politics go, is a story of futile revolutionary upheaval.': 663, 'The scale of this history will not\\npermit us to tell of the intricate struggles of that time, of the attempts to break up estates and restore the land to\\nthe free farmer, of proposals to abolish debts in whole or in part.': 907, 'There was revolt and civil war.': 155, 'In 73 B.C., the\\ndistresses of Italy were enhanced by a great insurrection of the slaves under Spartacus.': 502, 'The slaves of Italy revolted\\nwith some effect, for among them were the trained fighters of the gladiatorial shows.': 150, 'For two years Spartacus held\\nout in the crater of Vesuvius, which seemed at that time to be an extinct volcano.': 561, 'This insurrection was defeated\\nat last and suppressed with frantic cruelty.': 163, 'Six thousand captured Spartacists were crucified along the Appian\\nWay, the great highway that runs southward out of Rome 71 B.C..': 558, 'The common man never made head against the forces that were subjugating and degrading him.': 547, 'But the big rich\\nmen who were overcoming him were even in his defeat preparing a new power in the Roman world over\\nthemselves and him, the power of the army.': 1399, 'Before the Second Punic War the army of Rome was a levy of free farmers, who, according to their quality, rode\\nor marched afoot to battle.': 163, 'This was a very good force for wars close at hand, but not the sort of army that will go\\nabroad and bear long campaigns with patience.': 379, 'And moreover as the slaves multiplied and the estates grew, the\\nsupply of freespirited fighting farmers declined.': 152, 'It was a popular leader named Marius who introduced a new\\nfactor.': 316, 'North Africa after the overthrow of the Carthaginian civilization had become a semibarbaric kingdom,\\nthe kingdom of Numidia.': 195, 'The Roman power fell into conflict with Jugurtha, king of this state, and experienced\\nenormous difficulties in subduing him.': 390, 'Marius was made consul, in a phase of public indignation, to end this\\ndiscreditable war.': 449, 'This he did by raising paid troops and drilling them hard.': 44, 'Jugurtha was brought in chains to\\nRome 106 B.C.': 48, 'and Marius, when his time of office had expired, held on to his consulship illegally with his\\nnewly created legions.': 277, 'There was no power in Rome to restrain him.': 136, 'With Marius began the third phase in the development of the Roman power, the Republic of the Military\\nCommanders.': 339, 'For now began a period in which the leaders of the paid legions fought for the mastery of the\\nRoman world.': 690, 'Against Marius was pitted the aristocratic Sulla who had served under him in Africa.': 21, 'Each in turn\\nmade a great massacre of his political opponents.': 763, 'Men were proscribed and executed by the thousand, and their\\nestates were sold.': 71, 'After the bloody rivalry of these two and the horror of the revolt of Spartacus, came a phase in\\nwhich Lucullus and Pompey the Great and Crassus and Julius Caesar were the masters of armies and dominated\\naffairs.': 440, 'It was Crassus who defeated Spartacus.': 37, 'Lucullus conquered Asia Minor and penetrated to Armenia, and\\nretired with great wealth into private life.': 752, 'Crassus thrusting further invaded Persia and was defeated and slain by\\nthe Parthians.': 59, 'After a long rivalry Pompey was defeated by Julius Caesar 48 B.C.': 126, 'and murdered in Egypt,\\nleaving Julius Caesar sole master of the Roman world.': 506, 'The figure of Julius Caesar is one that has stirred the human imagination out of all proportion to its merit or true\\nimportance.': 484, 'He has become a legend and a symbol.': 47, 'For us he is chiefly important as marking the transition from\\nthe phase of military adventurers to the beginning of the fourth stage in Roman expansion, the Early Empire.': 248, 'For\\nin spite of the profoundest economic and political convulsions, in spite of civil war and social degeneration,\\nthroughout all this time the boundaries of the Roman state crept outward and continued to creep outward to their\\nmaximum about 100 A.D.': 774, 'There had been something like an ebb during the doubtful phases of the Second Punic\\nWar, and again a manifest loss of vigour before the reconstruction of the army by Marius.': 250, 'The revolt of Spartacus\\nmarked a third phase.': 80, 'Julius Caesar made his reputation as a military leader in Gaul, which is now France and\\nBelgium.': 228, 'The chief tribes inhabiting this country belonged to the same Celtic people as the Gauls who had\\noccupied north Italy for a time, and who had afterwards raided into Asia Minor and settled down as the\\nGalatians.': 719, 'Caesar drove back a German invasion of Gaul and added all that country to the empire, and he twice\\ncrossed the Straits of Dover into Britain 55 and 54 B.C., where however he made no permanent conquest.A Short History of the World.': 596, 'The Growth of the Roman Empire 57Meanwhile Pompey the Great was consolidating Roman conquests that reached in the east to the Caspian Sea.': 121, 'At this time, the middle of the first century B.C., the Roman Senate was still the nominal centre of the Roman\\ngovernment, appointing consuls and other officials, granting powers and the like and a number of politicians,\\namong whom Cicero was an outstanding figure, were struggling to preserve the great traditions of republican\\nRome and to maintain respect for its laws.': 1765, 'But the spirit of citizenship had gone from Italy with the wasting away\\nof the free farmers it was a land now of

adventurers they feared and desired to control were the legions.': 597, 'Over the heads of the Senate Crassus and\\nPompey and Caesar divided the rule of the Empire between them The First Triumvirate.': 69, 'When presently Crassus\\nwas killed at distant Carrhae by the Parthians, Pompey and Caesar fell out.': 108, 'Pompey took up the republican side,\\nand laws were passed to bring Caesar to trial for his breaches of law and his disobedience to the decrees of the\\nSenate.': 157, 'It was illegal for a general to bring his troops out of the boundary of his command, and the boundary between\\nCaesars command and Italy was the Rubicon.': 117, 'In 49 B.C.': 1, 'he crossed the Rubicon, saying The die is cast and\\nmarched upon Pompey and Rome.': 330, 'It had been the custom in Rome in the past, in periods of military extremity, to elect a dictator with practically\\nunlimited powers to rule through the crisis.': 199, 'After his overthrow of Pompey, Caesar was made dictator first for ten\\nyears and then in 45 B.C.': 630, 'for life.': 224, 'In effect he was made monarch of the empire for life.': 676, 'There was talk of a\\nking, a word abhorrent to Rome since the expulsion of the Etruscans five centuries before.': 241, 'Caesar refused to be\\nking, but adopted throne and sceptre.': 108, 'After his defeat of Pompey, Caesar had gone on into Egypt and had made\\nlove to Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, the goddess queen of Egypt.': 333, 'She seems to have turned his head very\\ncompletely.': 92, 'He had brought back to Rome the Egyptian idea of a godking.': 139, 'His statue was set up in a temple with\\nan inscription To the Unconquerable God.': 114, 'The expiring republicanism of Rome flared up in a last protest, and\\nCaesar was stabbed to death in the Senate at the foot of the statue of his murdered rival, Pompey the Great.': 173, 'Thirteen years more of this conflict of ambitious personalities followed.': 240, 'There was a second Triumvirate of\\nLepidus, Mark Antony and Octavian Caesar, the latter the nephew of Julius Caesar.': 64, 'Octavian like his uncle took\\nthe poorer, hardier western provinces where the best legions were recruited.': 276, 'In 31 B.C., he defeated Mark Antony,\\nhis only serious rival, at the naval battle of Actium, and made himself sole master of the Roman world.': 774, 'But\\nOctavian was a man of different quality altogether from Julius Caesar.': 272, 'He had no foolish craving to be God or\\nKing.': 8, 'He had no queenlover that he wished to dazzle.': 7, 'He restored freedom to the Senate and people of Rome.': 255, 'He declined to be dictator.': 8, 'The grateful Senate in return gave him the reality instead of the forms of power.': 221, 'He\\nwas to be called not King indeed, but Princeps and Augustus.': 92, 'He became Augustus Caesar, the first of the\\nRoman emperors 27 B.C.': 397, 'to 14 A.D..': 2, 'He was followed by Tiberius Caesar 14 to 37 A.D. and he by others,

slavery that\\nwas chained at night and driven with whips to the farm or quarry, to the slave whose master found it advantageous\\nto leave him to cultivate his patch or work his craft and own his wife like a freeman, provided he paid in a\\nsatisfactory quittance to his owner.': 652, 'There were armed slaves.': 45, 'At the opening of the period of the Punic wars, in 264 B.C., the Etruscan sport of\\nsetting slaves to fight for their lives was revived in Rome.': 202, 'It grew rapidly fashionable and soon every great\\nRoman rich man kept a retinue of gladiators, who sometimes fought in

'And slaveowners began to\\nrealize that the profit and comfort they got from their slaves increased with the selfrespect of these unfortunates.': 178, 'But also the moral tone of the community was

city of Alexandria became the centre of Egyptian religious life, and indeed of\\nthe religious life of the whole Hellenic world.': 1619, 'A great temple, the Serapeum, was set up by Ptolemy I at which a\\nsort of trinity of gods was worshipped.': 650, 'These were Serapis who was OsirisApis rechristened, Isis and Horus.': 1, 'These were not regarded as separate gods but as three aspects of one god, and Serapis was identified with the\\nGreek Zeus, the Roman Jupiter and the Persian sungod.': 429, 'This worship spread wherever the Hellenic influence\\nextended, even into North India and Western

followed the Roman standards to Scotland\\nand Holland.': 364, 'But there were many rivals to the SerapisIsis religion.': 141, 'Prominent among these was Mithraism.': 69, 'This\\nwas a religion of Persian origin, and it centred upon some now forgotten mysteries about Mithras sacrificing a\\nsacred and benevolent bull.': 359, 'Here we seem to have something more primordial than the complicated

bleeds copiously from a wound in its side, and\\nfrom this blood springs new life.': 859, 'The votary to Mithraism actually bathed in the blood of the sacrificial bull.': 50, 'At\\nhis initiation he went beneath a scaffolding upon which a bull was killed so that the blood could actually run\\ndown on him.': 528, 'Both these religions, and the same is true of many other of the numerous parallel

an active persecutor of the little band of disciples\\nafter the crucifixion.': 427, 'Then he was suddenly converted to Christianity, and he changed his name to Paul.': 64, 'He was a\\nman of great intellectual vigour and deeply and passionately interested in the religious movements of the time.': 926, 'He\\nwas well versed in Judaism and in the Mithraism and Alexandrian religion of the day.': 94, 'He carried over many of\\ntheir ideas and terms of expression into Christianity.': 226, 'He did very little to enlarge or develop the original teaching\\nof Jesus, the teaching of the Kingdom of Heaven.': 218, 'But he taught that Jesus was not only the promised Christ, the\\npromised leader of the Jews, but also that his death was a sacrifice, like the deaths of the ancient sacrificial\\nvictims of the primordial civilizations, for the redemption of mankind.': 485, 'When religions flourish side by side they tend to pick up each others ceremonial and other outward peculiarities.': 108, 'Buddhism, for example, in China has now almost the same sort of temples and priests and uses as Taoism, which\\nfollows in the teachings of Lao Tse.': 208, 'Yet the original teachings of Buddhism and Taoism were almost flatly\\nopposed.': 69, 'And it reflects no doubt or discredit upon the essentials of Christian teaching that it took over not merely\\nsuch formal things as the shaven priest, the votive offering, the altars, candles, chanting and images of the\\nAlexandrian and Mithraic faiths, but adopted even their devotional phrases and their theological Osiris, was a god\\nwho died to rise again and give men immortality.': 1016, 'And presently the spreading Christian community was greatly\\ntorn by complicated theological disputes about the relationship of this God Jesus to God the Father of Mankind.': 145, 'The Arians taught that Jesus was divine, but distant from and inferior to the Father.': 32, 'The Sabellians taught that\\nJesus was merely an aspect of the Father, and that God was Jesus and Father at the same time just as a man may\\nbe a father and an artificer at the same time and the Trinitarians taught a more subtle doctrine that God was both\\none and three, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.': 1053, 'For a time it seemed that Arianism would prevail over its rivals, and\\nthen after disputes, violence and wars, the Trinitarian formula became the accepted formula of all Christendom.': 590, 'It\\nmay be found in its completest expression in the Athanasian Creed.': 197, 'We offer no comment on these controversies here.': 7, 'They do not sway history as the personal teaching of Jesus\\nsways history.': 657, 'The personal teaching of Jesus does seem to mark a new phase in the moral and spiritual life of our\\nrace.': 713, 'Its insistence upon the universal Fatherhood of God and the implicit brotherhood of all men, its insistence\\nupon the sacredness of every human personality as a living temple of God, was to have the profoundest effect\\nupon all the subsequent social and political life of mankind.': 1869, 'With Christianity, with the spreading teachings of\\nJesus, a new respect appears in the world for man as man.': 1110, 'It may be true, as hostile critics of Christianity have\\nurged, that St. Paul preached obedience to slaves, but it is equally true that the whole spirit of the teachings of\\nJesus preserved in the gospels was against the subjugation of man by man.': 719, 'And still more distinctly was\\nChristianity opposed to such outrages upon human dignity as the gladiatorial combats in the arena.': 614, 'Throughout the first two centuries after Christ, the Christian religion spread throughout the Roman Empire,\\nweaving together an evergrowing multitude of converts into a new community of ideas and will.': 1052, 'The attitude of\\nthe emperors varied between hostility and toleration.': 49, 'There were attempts to suppress this new faith in both the\\nsecond and third centuries and

'It is difficult to visualize the state of affairs in the world at that time.': 814, 'Over France, Spain, Italy and the\\nBalkan peninsula, the great cities that had flourished under the early empire

is probable that there were two chief causes for the new westward drift of the nomadic Mongolians.': 479, 'One was\\nthe consolidation of the great empire of China, its extension northward and the

rich men of the later Roman Republic, and then the taxgatherers of the military emperors had\\nutterly consumed its vitality.': 341, 'So we have the factors of thrust, means and opportunity.': 49, 'There was pressure from\\nthe east, rot in the west and an open road.': 138, 'The Hun had reached the eastern boundaries of European Russia by the first century A.D., but it was not until

mercenary bands in the pay of Stilicho the Vandal, the\\nmaster of Honorius.': 343, 'Presently they were in possession of Pannonia, the empty nest of the Vandals.': 24, 'By the second quarter of the

of tributary\\nGermanic tribes his empire extended from the Rhine cross the plains into Central Asia.': 340, 'He exchanged\\nambassadors with China.': 6, 'His head camp was in the plain of Hungary east of the Danube.': 99, 'There he was visited by\\nan envoy from Constantinople, Priscus, who has left us an account of his state.': 171, 'The way of living of these\\nMongols was very like the way of living of the primitive Aryans they had replaced.': 436, 'The common folk were in\\nhuts and tents the chiefs lived in great stockaded timber halls.': 586, 'There were feasts and drinking and singing by the\\nbards.': 10, 'The Homeric heroes and even the Macedonian companions of Alexander would probably have felt more at\\nhome in the campcapital of Attila than they would have done in the cultivated and decadent court of Theodosius\\nII, the son of Arcadius, who was then reigning in Constantinople.': 642, 'For a time it seemed as though the nomads under the leadership of the Huns and Attila would play the same part\\ntowards the GraecoRoman civilization of the Mediterranean countries that the barbaric Greeks had played long\\nago to the aegean civilization.': 904, 'It looked like history repeating itself upon a larger stage.': 755, 'But the Huns were much\\nmore wedded to the nomadic life than the early Greeks, who were rather migratory cattle farmers than true\\nnomads.': 567, 'The Huns raided and plundered but did not settle.': 19, 'For some years Attila bullied Theodosius as he chose.': 168, 'His armies devastated and looted right down to the walls of\\nConstantinople, Gibbon says that he totally destroyed no less than seventy cities in the Balkan peninsula, and\\nTheodosius bought him off by payments of tribute and tried to get rid of him for good by sending secret agents to\\nassassinate him.': 349, 'In 451 Attila turned his attention to the remains of the Latinspeaking half of the empire and\\ninvaded Gaul.': 353, 'Nearly every town in northern Gaul was sacked.': 108, 'Franks, Visigoths and the imperial forces united\\nagainst him and he was defeated at Troyes in a vast dispersed battle in which a multitude of men, variously\\nestimated as between 150,000 and 300,000, were killed.': 470, 'This checked him in Gaul, but it did not exhaust his\\nenormous military resources.': 64, 'Next year he came into Italy by way of Venetia, burnt Aquileia and Padua and\\nlooted Milan.': 271, 'Numbers of fugitives from these north Italian towns and particularly from Padua fled to islands in the lagoons at\\nthe head of the Adriatic and laid there the foundations of the city state of Venice, which was to become one of the\\ngreatest of the trading centres in the middle ages.': 733, 'In 453 Attila died suddenly after a

dawn of the sixth century was an age of\\ndivision and of intellectual darkness throughout the western world.': 1028, 'Had it not been for the monks and Christian\\nmissionaries Latin learning might have perished altogether.': 114, 'Why had the Roman Empire grown and why had it so completely decayed It grew because at first the idea of\\ncitizenship held it together.': 483, 'Throughout the days

citizen, confident of their rights under the Roman law and willing to make sacrifices in\\nthe name of Rome.': 1489, 'The prestige of Rome as of something just and great and lawupholding spread far beyond\\nthe Roman boundaries.': 693, 'But even as early as the Punic wars the sense of citizenship was being undermined by the\\ngrowth of wealth and slavery.': 281, 'Citizenship spread indeed but not the idea of citizenship.': 148, 'The Roman Empire was after all a very primitive organization it did not educate, did not explain itself to its\\nincreasing multitudes of citizens, did not invite their cooperation in its decisions.': 120, 'There was no network of\\nschools to ensure a common understanding, no distribution of news to sustain collective activity.': 138, 'The adventurers\\nwho

of its prestige and tradition, and that was the Latinspeaking half of the\\nCatholic Church.': 462, 'This lived while the empire died because it appealed to the minds and wills of men, because it\\nhad books and a great system of teachers and missionaries to hold it together, things stronger than any law or\\nlegions.': 1231, 'Throughout the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. while the empire

Persia and\\nByzantium it was an age of intolerance.': 131, 'Both empires were religious empires in a new way, in a way that greatly\\nhampered the free activities of the human mind.': 823, 'Of course the oldest empires in the world were religious empires, centring upon the worship of a god or of a\\ngodking.': 1021, 'Alexander was treated as a divinity and the Caesars were gods in so much as they had altars and\\ntemples devoted to them and the offering of incense was made a test of loyalty to the Roman state.': 501, 'But these older\\nreligions were essentially religions of act and fact.':

'But\\nthe new sort of religions that had come into the world, and particularly Christianity, turned inward.': 929, 'These new\\nfaiths demanded not simply conformity but understanding belief.': 314,

was not exhausted.': 116, 'Confined now to Central and NorthWestern Europe\\nand terribly muddled in their social and political ideas, they were nevertheless building up gradually and steadily\\na new social order and preparing unconsciously for the recovery of a power even more extensive than that they\\nhad previously enjoyed.': 947, 'We have told how at the beginning of the sixth century there remained no central government in Western Europe\\nat all.': 452, 'That world was divided up among numbers of local rulers holding their own as they could.': 700, 'This was too\\ninsecure a state of affairs to last a system of cooperation and association grew up in this disorder, the feudal\\nsystem, which has left its traces upon European life up to the present time.': 1181, 'This feudal system was a sort of\\ncrystallization of society about power.': 257, 'Everywhere the lone man felt insecure and was prepared to barter a certain\\namount of his liberty for help and protection.': 268, 'He sought a stronger man as his lord and protector he gave him\\nmilitary services and paid him dues, and in return he was confirmed in his possession of what was his.': 328, 'His lord\\nagain found safety in vassalage to a still greater lord.': 297, 'Cities also found it convenient to have feudal protectors, and\\nmonasteries and church estates bound themselves by similar ties.': 343, 'No doubt in many cases allegiance was claimed\\nbefore it was offered the system grew downward as well as upward.': 282, 'So a sort of pyramidal system grew up,\\nvarying widely in different localities, permitting at first a considerable play of violence and private warfare but\\nmaking steadily for order and a new reign of law.': 928, 'The pyramids grew up until some became recognizable as\\nkingdoms.': 161, 'Already by the early sixth century a Frankish kingdom existed under its founder Clovis in what is now\\nFrance and the Netherlands, and presently Visigothic and Lombard and Gothic kingdoms were in existence.': 447, 'The Moslim when they crossed the Pyrenees in 720 found this Frankish kingdom under the practical rule of\\nCharles Martel, the Mayor of the Palace of a degenerate descendant of Clovis, and experienced the decisive defeat\\nof Poitiers 732 at his hands.': 262, 'This Charles Martel was practically overlord of Europe north of the Alps from theA Short History of the World.': 115, 'He ruled over a multitude of subordinate lords speaking FrenchLatin, and High and Low\\nGerman languages.': 80, 'His son Pepin extinguished the last descendants of Clovis

353, 'He conquered North Italy and made himself master of Rome.': 241, 'Approaching the story of Europe as we do from the wider horizons of a world history we can see much more\\ndistinctly than the mere nationalist historian how cramping and disastrous this tradition of the Latin Roman\\nEmpire was.': 1040, 'A narrow intense struggle for this phantom predominance was to consume European energy for more\\nthan a thousand years.': 302, 'Through all that period it is possible to trace certain unquenchable antagonisms they run\\nthrough the wits of Europe like the obsessions of a demented mind.': 369, 'One driving force was this ambition of\\nsuccessful rulers, which Charlemagne Charles the Great embodied, to become Caesar.': 114, 'The realm of\\nCharlemagne consisted of a complex of feudal German states at various stages of barbarism.': 177, 'West of the Rhine,\\nmost of these German peoples had learnt to speak various Latinized dialects which fused at last to form French.': 304, 'East of the Rhine, the racially similar German peoples did not lose their German speech.': 158, 'On account of this,\\ncommunication was difficult between these two groups of barbarian conquerors and a split easily brought about.': 238, 'The split was made the more easy by the fact that the Frankish usage made it seem natural to divide the empire of\\nCharlemagne among his sons at his death.': 824, 'So one aspect of the history of Europe from the days of Charlemagne\\nonwards is a history of first this monarch and his family and then that, struggling to a precarious headship of the\\nkings, princes, dukes, bishops and cities of Europe, while a steadily deepening antagonism between the French\\nand German speaking elements develops in the medley.': 1417, 'There was a formality of election for each emperor and\\nthe climax of his ambition was to struggle to the possession of that wornout, misplaced capital Rome and to a\\ncoronation there.': 195, 'The next factor in the European political disorder was the resolve of the Church at Rome to make no temporal\\nprince but the Pope of Rome himself emperor in effect.': 329, 'He was already pontifex maximus for all practical\\npurposes he held the decaying city if he had no armies he had at least a vast propaganda organization in his\\npriests throughout the whole Latin world if he had little power over mens bodies he held the keys of heaven and\\nhell in their imaginations and could exercise much influence upon their souls.': 1852, 'So throughout the middle ages\\nwhile one prince manoeuvred against another first for equality, then for ascendancy, and at last for the supreme\\nprize, the Pope of Rome, sometimes boldly, sometimes craftily, sometimes feeblyfor the Popes were a\\nsuccession of oldish men and the average reign of a Pope was not more than two yearsmanoeuvred for the\\nsubmission of all the princes to himself as the ultimate overlord of Christendom.': 1266, 'But these antagonisms of prince against prince and of Emperor against Pope do not by any means exhaust the\\nfactors of the European confusion.': 76, 'There was still an Emperor in Constantinople speaking Greek and claiming the\\nallegiance of all Europe.': 181, 'When Charlemagne sought to revive the empire, it was merely the Latin end of the\\nempire he revived.': 565, 'It was natural that a sense of rivalry between Latin Empire and Greek Empire should develop\\nvery readily.': 66, 'And still more readily did the rivalry of Greekspeaking Christianity and the newer Latinspeaking\\nversion develop.': 188, 'The Pope of Rome claimed to be the successor of St. Peter, the chief of the apostles of Christ,\\nand the head of the Christian community everywhere.': 140, 'Neither the emperor nor the patriarch in Constantinople\\nwere disposed to acknowledge this claim.': 106, 'A dispute about a fine point in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity\\nconsummated a long series of dissensions in a final rupture in 1054.': 182, 'The Latin Church and the Greek Church\\nbecame and remained thereafter distinct and frankly antagonistic.': 178, 'This antagonism must be added to the others in\\nour estimate of the conflicts that wasted Latin Christendom in the middle ages.': 152, 'Upon this divided world of Christendom rained the blows of three sets of antagonists.': 548, 'About the Baltic and North\\nSeas remained a series of Nordic tribes who were only very slowly and reluctantly Christianized these were the\\nNorthmen.': 149, 'They had taken to the sea and piracy, and were raiding all the Christian coasts down to Spain.': 129, 'They\\nhad pushed up the Russian rivers to the desolate central lands and brought their shipping over into the\\nsouthflowing rivers.': 162, 'They had come

but his brief empire fell to pieces at his death\\nthrough that political weakness of the barbaric peoplesdivision among a rulers sons.': 579, 'It is interesting to speculate\\nwhat might have happened if this temporary union of the Northmen had endured.': 101, 'They were a race of astonishing\\nboldness and energy.': 67, 'They sailed in their galleys even to Iceland and Greenland.': 104, 'They were the first Europeans to\\nland on American soil.': 348, 'Later on Norman adventurers were to recover Sicily from the Saracens and sack Rome.': 21, 'It\\nis a fascinating thing to imagine what a great northern seafaring power might have grown out of Canutes\\nkingdom, reaching from America to Russia.': 762, 'To the east of the Germans and Latinized Europeans was a medley of Slav tribes and Turkish peoples.': 206, 'Prominent\\namong these were the Magyars or Hungarians who were coming westward throughout the eighth and ninth\\ncenturies.': 274, 'Charlemagne held them for a time, but after his death they established themselves in what is now\\nHungary and after the fashion of their kindred predecessors, the Huns, raided every summer into the settled parts\\nof Europe.': 450, 'In 938 they went through Germany into France, crossed the Alps into North Italy, and so came home,\\nburning, robbing and destroying.': 289, 'Finally pounding away from the south at the vestiges of the Roman Empire were the Saracens.': 114, 'They had made\\nthemselves largely masters of the sea their only formidable adversaries upon the water were the Northmen, the\\nRussian Northmen out of the Black Sea and the Northmen of the west.': 683, 'Hemmed in by these more vigorous and aggressive peoples, amidst forces they did not understand and dangers\\nthey could not estimate, Charlemagne and after him a series of other ambitious spirits took up the futile drama of\\nrestoring the Western Empire under the name of the Holy Roman Empire.': 381, 'From the time of Charlemagne onward\\nthis idea obsessed the political life of Western Europe, while in the East the Greek half of the Roman power\\ndecayed and dwindled until at last nothing remained of it at all but the corrupt trading city of Constantinople and a\\nfew miles of territory about it.': 1123, 'Politically the continent of Europe remained traditional and uncreative from the\\ntime of Charlemagne onward for a thousand years.': 517, 'The name of Charlemagne looms large in European history but his personality is but indistinctly seen.': 368, 'He could\\nnot read nor write, but he had a considerable respect for

the Popes came into conflict with the growing power of the French King.': 681, 'During the lifetime of the\\nEmperor Frederick II, Germany fell into disunion, and the French King began to play the rle

'A\\nTurkish people from the country to the north of China rose suddenly to prominence in the worlds affairs, and\\nachieved such a series of conquests as has no parallel in history.': 843, 'At the opening of the\\nthirteenth century they were a horde of nomadic horsemen, living very much as their predecessors, the Huns, had\\ndone, subsisting chiefly upon meat and mares milk and living in tents

armies were organized to a very\\nhigh level of efficiency and they had with them a new Chinese invention, gunpowder, which they used in small\\nfield guns.': 502, 'He completed the conquest of the Kin Empire and then swept his hosts right across Asia to Russia\\n1235, an altogether amazing march.': 158, 'Kieff was destroyed in 1240, and nearly all Russia became tributary to the\\nMongols.': 182, 'Poland was ravaged, and a mixed army of Poles and Germans was annihilated at the battle of Liegnitz\\nin Lower Silesia in 1241.': 84, 'The Emperor Frederick II does not seem to have made any great efforts to stay the\\nadvancing tide.': 688, 'It is only recently, says Bury in his notes to Gibbons Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, that European\\nhistory has begun to understand that the successes of the Mongol army which overran Poland and occupied\\nHungary in the spring of A.D. 1241 were won by consummate strategy and were not due to a mere overwhelming\\nsuperiority of numbers.': 434, 'But this fact has not yet become a matter of common knowledge the vulgar opinion\\nwhich represents the Tartars as a wild horde carrying all before them solely by their multitude, and galloping\\nthrough Eastern Europe without a strategic plan, rushing at all obstacles and overcoming them by mere weight,\\nstill prevails.': 565, 'It was wonderful how punctually and effectually the

taken care to inform themselves by a wellorganized system of spies on the other hand, the\\nHungarians and the Christian powers, like childish barbarians, knew hardly anything about their enemies.': 938, 'But though the Mongols were victorious at Liegnitz, they did not continue their drive westward.': 82, 'They were\\ngetting into woodlands and hilly country, which did not suit their tactics and so they turned southward and\\nprepared to settle in Hungary, massacring or assimilating the kindred Magyar, even as these had previously\\nmassacred and assimilated the mixed Scythians and Avars and Huns before them.': 260, 'From the Hungarian plain they\\nwould probably have made raids west and south as the Hungarians had done in the ninth century, the Avars in the\\nseventh and eighth and the Huns in the fifth.': 839, 'But Ogdai died suddenly, and in 1242 there was trouble about the\\nsuccession, and recalled by this, the undefeated hosts of Mongols began to pour back across Hungary

Empire.': 288, 'Mangu Khan succeeded Ogdai Khan as Great Khan in 1251, and\\nmade his brother Kublai Khan governor of China.': 207, 'In 1280 Kublai Khan had been formally recognized Emperor of\\nChina, and so founded the Yuan dynasty which lasted until 1368.': 72, 'While the last ruins of the Sung rule were going\\ndown in China, another brother of Mangu, Hulagu, was conquering Persia and Syria.': 247, 'The Mongols displayed a\\nbitter animosity to Islam at this time, and not only massacred the population of Bagdad when they captured that\\ncity, but set to work to destroy the immemorial irrigation system which had kept Mesopotamia incessantly\\nprosperous and populous from the early days of Sumeria.': 752, 'From that time until our own Mesopotamia has been a\\ndesert of

became Moslim.': 427, 'The\\nChinese threw off the rule of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, and set up the native Ming dynasty which flourished from\\n1368 to 1644.': 227, 'The Russians remained tributary to the Tartar hordes upon the southeast steppes until 1480, when\\nthe Grand Duke of Moscow repudiated his allegiance and laid the foundation of modern Russia.': 440, 'In the fourteenth century there was a brief revival of Mongol vigour under Timurlane, a descendant of Jengis\\nKhan.': 256, 'He established himself in Western Turkestan, assumed the title of Grand Khan in 1369, and conquered\\nfrom Syria to Delhi.': 77, 'He was the most savage and destructive of all the Mongol conquerors.': 42, 'He established an\\nempire of desolation that did not survive his death.': 290, 'In 1505, however, a descendant of this Timur, an adventurer\\nnamed Baber, got together an army with guns and swept down upon the plains of India.': 468, 'His grandson Akbar\\n15561605 completed his conquests, and this Mongol or Mogul as the Arabs called it dynasty ruled in Delhi\\nover the greater part of India until the eighteenth century.': 479, 'One of the consequences of the first great sweep of Mongol conquest in the thirteenth century was to drive a\\ncertain tribe of Turks, the Ottoman Turks, out of Turkestan into Asia Minor.': 1029, 'They extended and consolidated their\\npower in Asia Minor, crossed the Dardanelles and conquered Macedonia, Serbia and Bulgaria, until at last\\nConstantinople remained like an island amongst the Ottoman dominions.': 525, 'In 1453 the Ottoman Sultan,\\nMuhammad II, took Constantinople, attacking it from the European side with a great number of guns.': 582, 'This event\\ncaused intense excitement in Europe and there was talk of a crusade, but the day of the crusades was past.': 122, 'In the course of the sixteenth century the Ottoman Sultans conquered Bagdad, Hungary, Egypt and most of North\\nAfrica, and their fleet made them masters of the Mediterranean.': 502, 'They very nearly took Vienna, and they exacted a\\ntribute from the Emperor.': 85, 'There were but two items to offset the general ebb of Christian dominion in theA Short History of the World.': 190,

broke the pride of the Ottomans, and restored\\nthe Mediterranean waters to Christian ascendancy.': 100, 'The Intellectual Revival of the Europeans\\nTHROUGHOUT the twelfth century there were many signs that the European intelligence was recovering\\ncourage and leisure, and preparing to take up again the intellectual enterprises of the first Greek scientific\\nenquiries and such speculations as those of the Italian Lucretius.': 737, 'The causes of this revival were many and\\ncomplex.': 134, 'The suppression of private war, the higher standards of comfort and security that followed the crusades,\\nand the stimulation of mens minds by the experiences of these expeditions were no doubt necessary preliminary\\nconditions.': 400, 'Trade was reviving cities were recovering ease and safety the standard of education was arising in\\nthe church and spreading among laymen.': 277, 'The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were a period of growing,\\nindependent or quasiindependent cities Venice, Florence, Genoa, Lisbon, Paris, Bruges, London, Antwerp,\\nHamburg, Nuremberg, Novgorod, Wisby and Bergen for example.': 332, 'They were all trading cities with many\\ntravellers, and where men trade and travel they talk and think.': 466, 'The polemics of the Popes and princes, the\\nconspicuous savagery and wickedness of the persecution of heretics, were exciting men to doubt the authority of\\nthe church and question and discuss fundamental things.': 472, 'We have seen how the Arabs were the means of restoring Aristotle to Europe, and how such a prince as Frederick\\nII acted as a channel through which Arabic philosophy and science played upon the renascent European mind.': 506, 'Still more influential in the stirring up of mens ideas were the Jews.': 116, 'Their very existence was a note of\\ninterrogation to the claims of the church.': 137, 'And finally the secret, fascinating enquiries of the alchemists were\\nspreading far and wide and setting men to the petty, furtive and yet fruitful resumption of experimental science.': 511, 'And the stir in mens minds was by no means confined now to the independent and well educated.': 142, 'The mind of\\nthe common man was awake in the world as it had never been before in all the experience of mankind.': 921, 'In spite of\\npriest and persecution, Christianity does seem to have carried a mental ferment wherever its teaching reached.': 257, 'It\\nestablished a direct relation between the conscience of the individual man and the God of Righteousness, so that\\nnow if need arose he had the courage to form his own judgment upon prince or prelate or creed.': 607, 'As early as the eleventh century philosophical discussion had begun again in Europe, and there were great and\\ngrowing universities at Paris, Oxford, Bologna and other centres.': 806, 'There medieval schoolmen took up again and\\nthrashed out a series of questions upon the value and meaning of words that were a necessary preliminary to clear\\nthinking in the scientific age that was to follow.': 608, 'And standing by himself because of his distinctive genius was\\nRoger Bacon circa 1210 to circa 1293, a Franciscan of Oxford, the father of modern experimental science.': 149, 'His\\nname deserves a prominence in our history second only to that of Aristotle.': 357, 'His writings are one long tirade against ignorance.': 338, 'He told his age it was ignorant, an incredibly bold thing to do.': 219, 'Nowadays a man may tell the world it is as silly as it is solemn, that all its methods are still infantile and clumsy\\nand its dogmas childish assumptions, without much physical danger but these peoples of the middle ages when\\nthey were not actually being massacred or starving or dying of pestilence, were passionately convinced of the\\nwisdom, the completeness and finality of their beliefs, and disposed to resent any reflections upon them very\\nbitterly.': 1681, 'Roger Bacons writings were like a flash of light in a profound darkness.': 183, 'He combined his attack upon the\\nignorance of his times with a wealth of suggestion for the increase of knowledge.': 425, 'In his passionate insistence\\nupon the need of experiment and of collecting knowledge, the spirit of Aristotle lives again in him.': 434, 'Experiment,\\nexperiment, that is the burthen of Roger Bacon.A Short History of the World.': 17, 'The Intellectual Revival of the Europeans 90Yet of Aristotle himself Roger Bacon fell foul.': 38, 'He fell foul of him because men, instead of facing facts boldly, sat\\nin rooms and pored over the bad Latin translations which were then all that was available of the master.': 292, 'If I had\\nmy way, he wrote, in his intemperate fashion, I should burn all the books of Aristotle, for the study of them can\\nonly lead to a loss of time, produce error, and increase ignorance, a sentiment that Aristotle would probably have\\nechoed could he have returned to a world in which his works were not so much read as worshippedand that, as\\nRoger Bacon showed, in these most abominable translations.': 1376, 'Throughout his books, a little disguised by the necessity of seeming to square it all with orthodoxy for fear of the\\nprison and worse, Roger Bacon shouted to mankind, Cease to be ruled by dogmas and authorities look at the\\nworld Four chief sources of ignorance he denounced respect for authority, custom, the sense of the ignorant\\ncrowd, and the vain, proud unteachableness of our dispositions.': 855, 'Overcome but these, and a world of power would\\nopen to men\\nMachines for navigating are possible without rowers, so that great ships suited to river or ocean, guided by one\\nman, may be borne with greater speed than if they were full of men.': 2366, 'Likewise cars may be made so that without a\\ndraught animal they may be moved cum impetu inoestimable, as we deem the scythed chariots to have been from\\nwhich antiquity fought.': 513, 'And flying machines are possible, so that a man may sit in the middle turning some\\ndevice by which artificial wings may beat the air in the manner of a flying bird.': 518, 'So Roger Bacon wrote, but three more centuries were to elapse before men began any systematic attempts to\\nexplore the hidden stores of power and interest he realized so clearly existed beneath the dull surface of human\\naffairs.': 830, 'But the Saracenic world not only gave Christendom the stimulus of its philosophers and alchemists it also gave it\\npaper.': 685, 'It is scarcely too much to say that paper made the intellectual revival of Europe possible.': 458, 'Paper originated\\nin China, where its use probably goes back to the second century B.C.': 398, 'In 751 the Chinese made an attack upon the\\nArab Moslems in Samarkand they were repulsed, and among the prisoners taken from them were some skilled\\npapermakers, from whom the art was learnt.': 623, 'Arabic paper manuscripts from the ninth century onward still exist.': 423, 'The manufacture entered Christendom either through Greece or by the capture of Moorish papermills during the\\nChristian reconquest of Spain.': 51, 'But under the Christian Spanish the product deteriorated sadly.': 6, 'Good paper was\\nnot made in Christian Europe until the end of the thirteenth century, and then it was Italy which led the world.': 981, 'Only by the fourteenth century did the manufacture reach Germany, and not until the end of that century was it\\nabundant and cheap enough for the printing of books to be a practicable business proposition.': 599, 'Thereupon printing\\nfollowed naturally and necessarily, for printing is the most obvious of inventions, and the intellectual life of the\\nworld entered upon a new and far more vigorous phase.': 1549, 'It ceased to be a little trickle from mind to mind it\\nbecame a broad flood, in which thousands and presently scores and hundreds of thousands of minds participated.': 472, 'One immediate result of this achievement of printing was the appearance of an abundance of Bibles in the world.': 532, 'Another was a cheapening of schoolbooks.': 3, 'The knowledge of reading spread swiftly.': 121, 'There was not only a great\\nincrease of books in the world, but the books that were now made were plainer to read and so easier to\\nunderstand.': 1224, 'Instead of toiling at a crabbed text and then thinking over its significance, readers now could think\\nunimpeded as they read.': 159, 'With this increase in the facility of reading, the reading public grew.': 105, 'The book ceased to\\nbe a highly decorated toy or a scholars mystery.': 53, 'People began to write books to be read as well as looked at by\\nordinary people.': 428, 'They wrote in the ordinary language and not in Latin.': 67, 'With the fourteenth century the real\\nhistory of the European literature begins.': 558, 'So far we have been dealing only with the Saracenic share in the European revival.': 142, 'Let us turn now to the\\ninfluence of the Mongol conquests.': 100, 'They stimulated the geographical imagination of Europe enormously.': 33, 'For a\\ntime under the Great Khan, all Asia and Western Europe enjoyed an open intercourse all the roads were\\ntemporarily open, and representatives of every nation appeared at the court of Karakorum.': 388, 'The barriers between\\nEurope and Asia set up by the religious feud of Christianity and Islam were lowered.': 133, 'Great hopes wereA Short History of the World.': 2, 'The Intellectual Revival of the Europeans 91entertained by the papacy for the conversion of the Mongols to Christianity.': 9, 'Their only religion so far had been\\nShumanism, a primitive paganism.': 201, 'Envoys of the Pope, Buddhist priests from India, Parisian and Italian and\\nChinese artificers, Byzantine and Armenian merchants, mingled with Arab officials and Persian and Indian\\nastronomers and mathematicians at the Mongol court.': 112, 'We hear too much in history of the campaigns and\\nmassacres of the Mongols, and not enough of their curiosity and desire for learning.': 483, 'Not perhaps as an originative\\npeople, but as transmitters of knowledge and method their influence upon the worlds history has been very great.': 1390, 'And everything one can learn of the vague and romantic personalities of Jengis or Kublai tends to confirm the\\nimpression that these men were at least as understanding and creative monarchs as either that flamboyant but\\negotistical figure Alexander the Great or that raiser of political ghosts, that energetic but illiterate theologian\\nCharlemagne.': 676, 'One of the most interesting of these visitors to the Mongol Court was a certain Venetian, Marco Polo, who\\nafterwards set down his story in a book.': 212, 'He went to China about 1272 with his father and uncle, who had already\\nonce made the journey.': 377, 'The Great Khan had been deeply impressed by the elder Polos they were the first men of\\nthe Latin peoples he had seen and he sent them back with enquiries for teachers and learned men who could\\nexplain Christianity to him, and for various other European things that had aroused his curiosity.': 1101, 'Their visit with\\nMarco was their second visit.': 47, 'The three Polos started by way of Palestine and not by the Crimea, as in their previous expedition.': 126, 'They had with\\nthem a gold tablet and other indications from the Great Khan that must have greatly facilitated their journey.': 104, 'The\\nGreat Khan had asked for some oil from the lamp that burns in the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem and so thither\\nthey first went, and then by way of Cilicia into Armenia.': 431, 'They went thus far north because the Sultan of Egypt\\nwas raiding the Mongol domains at this time.': 509, 'Thence they came by way of Mesopotamia to Ormuz on the Persian\\nGulf, as if they contemplated a sea voyage.': 308, 'At Ormuz they met merchants from India.': 18, 'For some reason they did\\nnot take ship, but instead turned northward through the Persian deserts, and so by way of Balkh over the Pamir to\\nKashgar, and by way of Kotan and the Lob Nor into the Hwangho valley and on to Pekin.': 251, 'At Pekin was the\\nGreat Khan, and they were hospitably entertained.': 4, 'Marco particularly pleased Kublai he was young and clever, and it is clear he had mastered the Tartar language\\nvery thoroughly.': 122, 'He was given an official position and sent on several missions, chiefly in southwest China.': 91, 'The\\ntale he had to tell of vast stretches of smiling and prosperous country, all the way excellent hostelries for\\ntravellers, and fine vineyards, fields and gardens, of many abbeys of Buddhist monks, of manufactures of\\ncloth of silk and gold and many fine taffetas, a constant succession of cities and boroughs, and so on, first\\nroused the incredulity and then fired the imagination of all Europe.': 888, 'He told of Burmah, and of its great armies\\nwith hundreds of elephants, and how these animals were defeated by the Mongol bowmen, and also of the\\nMongol conquest of Pegu.': 734, 'He told of Japan, and greatly exaggerated the amount of gold in that country.': 129, 'For three\\nyears Marco ruled the city of Yangchow as governor, and he probably impressed the Chinese inhabitants as\\nbeing very little more of a foreigner than any Tartar would have been.': 644, 'He may also have been sent on a mission to\\nIndia.': 233, 'Chinese records mention a certain Polo attached to the imperial council in 1277, a very valuable\\nconfirmation of the general truth of the Polo story.': 193, 'The publication of Marco Polos travels produced a profound effect upon the European imagination.': 361, 'The\\nEuropean literature, and especially the European romance of the fifteenth century, echoes with the names in\\nMarco Polos story, with Cathay North China and Cambulac Pekin and the like.': 425, 'Two centuries later, among the readers of the Travels of Marco Polo was a certain Genoese mariner, Christopher\\nColumbus, who conceived the brilliant idea of sailing westward round the world to China.': 857, 'In Seville there is a\\ncopy of the Travels with marginal notes by Columbus.': 4, 'There were many reasons why the thought of a Genoese\\nshould be turned in this direction.': 188, 'Until its capture by the Turks in 1453 Constantinople had been an impartial\\ntrading mart between the Western world and the East, and the Genoese had traded there freely.': 529, 'But the Latin\\nVenetians, the bitter rivals of the Genoese, had been the allies and helpers of the Turks against the Greeks, andA Short History of the World.': 30, 'The Intellectual Revival of the Europeans 92with the coming of the Turks Constantinople turned an unfriendly face upon Genoese trade.': 388, 'The long forgotten\\ndiscovery that the world was round had gradually resumed its sway over mens minds.': 692, 'The idea of going\\nwestward to China was therefore a fairly

administration.': 1068, 'The full significance of that possibility in Europe still remains to be realized.': 234, 'Europe is still\\nnetted in boundaries drawn in the horse and road era.': 213, 'In America the effects were immediate.': 17, 'To the United States\\nof America, sprawling westward, it meant the possibility of a continuous access to Washington, however far the\\nfrontier travelled across the continent.': 257, 'It meant unity, sustained on a scale that would otherwise have been\\nimpossible.': 246, 'The steamboat was, if anything, a little ahead of the steam engine in its earlier phases.': 175, 'There was a steamboat, the\\nCharlotte Dundas, on the Firth of Clyde Canal in 1802, and in 1807 an American named Fulton had a steamer, the\\nClermont, with Britishbuilt engines, upon the Hudson River above New York.': 311, 'The first steamship to put to sea\\nwas also an American, the Phoenix, which went from New York Hoboken to Philadelphia.': 579, 'So, too, was the first\\nship using steam she also had sails to cross the Atlantic, the Savannah 1819.': 416, 'All these were paddlewheel\\nboats and paddlewheel boats are not adapted to work in heavy seas.': 125, 'The paddles smash too easily, and the boat is\\nthen disabled.': 15, 'The screw steamship followed rather slowly.': 122, 'Many difficulties had to be surmounted before the\\nscrew was a practicable thing.': 60, 'Not until the middle of the century did the tonnage of steamships upon the sea\\nbegin to overhaul that of sailing ships.': 658, 'After that the evolution in sea transport was rapid.': 109, 'For the first time men\\nbegan to cross the seas and oceans with some certainty as to the date of their arrival.': 785, 'The transatlantic crossing,\\nwhich had been an uncertain adventure of several weekswhich might stretch to monthswas accelerated, until in\\n1910 it was brought down, in the case of the fastest boats, to under five days, with a practically notifiable hour of\\narrival.': 271, 'Concurrently with the development of steam transport upon land and sea a new and striking addition to the\\nfacilities of human intercourse arose out of the investigations of Volta, Galvani and Faraday into various electrical\\nphenomena.': 1038, 'The electric telegraph came into existence in 1835.': 200, 'The first underseas cable was laid in 1851\\nbetween France and England.': 278, 'In a few years the telegraph system had spread over the civilized world, and news\\nwhich had hitherto travelled slowly from point to point became practically simultaneous throughout the earth.': 1093, 'These things, the steam railway and the electric telegraph, were to the popular imagination of the middle\\nnineteenth century the most striking and revolutionary of inventions, but they were only the most conspicuous and\\nclumsy first fruits of a far more extensive process.': 893, 'Technical knowledge and skill were developing with an\\nextraordinary rapidity, and to an extraordinary extent measured by the progress of any previous age.': 269, 'Far less\\nconspicuous at first in everyday life, but finally far more important, was the extension of mans power over\\nvarious structural materials.': 901, 'Before the middle of the eighteenth century iron was reduced from its ores by means\\nof wood charcoal, was handled in small pieces, and hammered and wrought into shape.': 412, 'It was material for a\\ncraftsman.': 22, 'Quality and treatment were enormously dependent upon the experience and sagacity of the individualA Short History of the World.': 316, 'The Development of

very definite upward limit, therefore, to the size of cannon.': 57, 'The blastfurnace rose in the eighteenth century and developed with the use of coke.': 329, 'Not before the eighteenth\\ncentury do we find rolled sheet iron 1728 and rolled rods and bars 1783.': 330, 'Nasmyths steam hammer came as\\nlate as 1838.': 178, 'The ancient world, because of its metallurgical inferiority, could not use steam.': 676, 'The steam engine, even the\\nprimitive pumping engine, could not develop before sheet iron was available.': 309, 'The early engines seem to the\\nmodern eye very pitiful and clumsy bits of ironmongery, but they were the utmost that the metallurgical science\\nof the time could do.': 556, 'As late as 1856 came the Bessemer process, and presently 1864 the openhearth process,\\nin which steel and every sort of iron could be melted, purified and cast in a manner and upon a scale hitherto\\nunheard of.': 864, 'Today in the electric furnace one may see tons of incandescent steel swirling about like boiling milk\\nin a saucepan.': 520, 'Nothing in the previous practical advances of mankind is comparable in its consequences to the\\ncomplete mastery over enormous masses of steel and iron and over their texture and quality which man has now\\nachieved.': 374, 'The railways and early engines of all sorts were the mere first triumphs of the new metallurgical\\nmethods.': 684, 'Presently came ships of iron and steel, vast bridges, and a new way of building with steel upon a\\ngigantic scale.': 930, 'Men realized too late that they had planned their railways with far too timid a gauge, that they\\ncould have organized their travelling with far more steadiness and comfort upon a much bigger scale.': 811, 'Before the nineteenth century there were no ships in the world much over 2,000 tons burthen now there is\\nnothing wonderful about a 50,000ton liner.': 932, 'There are people who sneer at this kind of progress as being a\\nprogress in mere size, but that sort of sneering merely marks the intellectual limitations of those who indulge in\\nit.': 454, 'The great ship or the steelframe building is not, as they imagine, a magnified version of the small ship or\\nbuilding of the past it is a thing different in kind, more lightly and strongly built, of finer and stronger materials\\ninstead of being a thing of precedent and ruleofthumb, it is a thing of subtle and intricate calculation.': 892, 'In the old\\nhouse or ship, matter was dominantthe material and its needs had to be slavishly obeyed in the new, matter had\\nbeen captured, changed, coerced.': 495, 'Think of the coal and iron and sand dragged out of the banks and pits,\\nwrenched, wrought, molten and cast, to be flung at last, a slender glittering pinnacle of steel and glass, six\\nhundred feet above the crowded city\\nWe have given these particulars of the advance in mans knowledge of the metallurgy of steel and its results by\\nway of illustration.': 528, 'A parallel story could be told of the metallurgy of copper and tin, and of a multitude of metals,\\nnickel and aluminum to name but two, unknown before the nineteenth century dawned.': 607, 'It is in this great and\\ngrowing mastery over substances, over different sorts of glass, over rocks and plasters and the like, over colours\\nand textures, that the main triumphs of the mechanical revolution have thus far been achieved.': 939, 'Yet we are still in\\nthe stage of the first fruits in the matter.': 489, 'We have the power, but we have still to learn how to use our power.': 466, 'Many of the first employments of these gifts of science have been vulgar, tawdry, stupid or horrible.': 332, 'The artist\\nand the adaptor have still hardly begun to work with the endless variety of substances now at their disposal.': 274, 'Parallel with this extension of mechanical possibilities the new science of electricity grew up.': 413, 'It was only in the\\neighties of the nineteenth century that this body of enquiry began to yield results to impress the vulgar mind.': 425, 'Then\\nsuddenly came electric light and electric traction, and the transmutation of forces, the possibility of sending\\npower, that could be changed into mechanical motion or light or heat as one chose, along a copper wire, as water\\nis sent along a pipe, began to come through to the ideas of ordinary people.': 1367, 'The British and French were at first the leading peoples in this great proliferation of knowledge but presently the\\nGermans, who had learnt humility under Napoleon, showed such zeal and pertinacity in scientific enquiry as to\\noverhaul these leaders.': 1031, 'British science was largely the creation of Englishmen and Scotchmen working outside the\\nordinary centres of erudition.A Short History of the World.': 147, 'The Development of Material Knowledge 113The universities of Britain were at this time in a state of educational retrogression, largely given over to a pedantic\\nconning of the Latin and Greek classics.': 357, 'French education, too, was dominated by the classical tradition of the\\nJesuit schools, and consequently it was not difficult for the Germans to organize a body of investigators, small\\nindeed in relation to the possibilities of the case, but large in proportion to the little band of British and French\\ninventors and experimentalists.': 401, 'And though this work of research and experiment was making Britain and France\\nthe most rich and powerful countries in the world, it was not making scientific and inventive men rich and\\npowerful.': 959, 'There is a necessary unworldliness about a sincere scientific man he is too preoccupied with his\\nresearch to plan and scheme how to make money out of it.': 315, 'The economic exploitation of his discoveries falls very\\neasily and naturally, therefore, into the hands of a more acquisitive type and so we find that the crops of rich men\\nwhich every fresh phase of scientific and technical progress has produced in Great Britain, though they have not\\ndisplayed quite the same passionate desire to insult and kill the goose that laid the national golden eggs as the\\nscholastic and clerical professions, have been quite content to let that profitable creature starve.': 825, 'Inventors and\\ndiscoverers came by nature, they thought, for cleverer people to profit by.': 459, 'In this matter the Germans were a little wiser.': 122, 'The German learned did not display the same vehement hatred of\\nthe new learning.': 302, 'They permitted its development.': 76, 'The German business man and manufacturer again had not\\nquite the same contempt for the man of science as had his British competitor.': 446, 'Knowledge, these Germans\\nbelieved, might be a cultivated crop, responsive to fertilizers.': 60, 'They did concede, therefore, a certain amount of\\nopportunity to the scientific mind their public expenditure on scientific work was relatively greater, and this\\nexpenditure was abundantly rewarded.': 342, 'By the latter half of the nineteenth century the German scientific worker\\nhad made German a necessary language for every science student who wished to keep abreast with the latest work\\nin his department, and in certain branches, and particularly in chemistry, Germany acquired a very great\\nsuperiority over her western neighbours.': 1382, 'The scientific effort of the sixties and seventies in Germany began to tell\\nafter the eighties, and the German gained steadily upon Britain and France in technical and industrial prosperity.': 508, 'A fresh phase in the history of invention opened when in the eighties a new type of engine came into use, an\\nengine in which the expansive force of an explosive mixture replaced the expansive force of steam.': 934, 'The light,\\nhighly efficient engines that were thus made possible were applied to the automobile, and developed at last to\\nreach such a pitch of lightness and efficiency as to render flightlong known to be possiblea practical\\nachievement.': 488, 'A successful flying machinebut not a machine large enough to take up a human bodywas made\\nby Professor Langley of the Smithsonian Institute of Washington as early as 1897.': 503, 'By 1909 the aeroplane was\\navailable for human locomotion.': 152, 'There had seemed to be a pause in the increase of human speed with the\\nperfection of railways and automobile road traction, but with the flying machine came fresh reductions in the\\neffective distance between one point of the earths surface and another.': 780, 'In the eighteenth century the distance from\\nLondon to Edinburgh was an eight days journey in 1918 the British Civil Air Transport Commission reported\\nthat the journey from London to Melbourne, halfway round the earth, would probably in a few years time be\\naccomplished in that same period of eight days.': 1177, 'Too much stress must not be laid upon these striking reductions in the time distances of one place from another.': 1032, 'They are merely one aspect of a much profounder and more momentous enlargement of human possibility.': 567, 'The\\nscience of agriculture and agricultural chemistry, for instance, made quite parallel advances during the nineteenth\\ncentury.': 584, 'Men learnt so to fertilize the soil as to produce quadruple and quintuple the crops got from the same area\\nin the seventeenth century.': 304, 'There was a still more extraordinary advance in medical science the average duration\\nof life rose, the daily efficiency increased, the waste of life through illhealth diminished.': 771, 'Now here altogether we have such a change in human life as to constitute a fresh phase of history.': 786, 'In a little more\\nthan a century this mechanical revolution has been brought about.': 416, 'In that time man made a stride in the material\\nconditions of his life vaster than he had done during the whole long interval between the palaeolithic stage and the\\nage of cultivation, or between the days of Pepi in Egypt and those of George III.': 1263, 'A new gigantic material\\nframework for human affairs has come into existence.': 558, 'Clearly it demands great readjustments of our social,\\neconomical and political methods.': 669, 'But these readjustments have necessarily waited upon the development of theA Short History of the World.': 362, 'The Development of Material

here called the mechanical revolution,\\nwhich was an entirely new thing in human experience arising out of the development of organized science, a new\\nstep like the invention of agriculture or the discovery of metals, with something else, quite different in its origins,\\nsomething for which there was already an historical precedent, the social and financial development which is\\ncalled the industrial revolution.': 1867, 'The two processes were going on together, they were constantly reacting upon\\neach other, but they were in root and essence different.': 547, 'There would have been an industrial revolution of sorts if\\nthere had been no coal, no steam, no machinery but in that case it would probably have followed far more closely\\nupon the lines of the social and financial developments of the later years of the Roman Republic.': 1307, 'It would have\\nrepeated the story of dispossessed free cultivators, gang labour, great estates, great financial fortunes, and a\\nsocially destructive financial process.': 1254, 'Even the factory method came before power and machinery.': 315, 'Factories were\\nthe product not of machinery, but of the division of labour.': 43, 'Drilled and sweated workers were making such\\nthings as millinery cardboard boxes and furniture, and colouring maps and book illustrations and so forth, before\\neven waterwheels had been used for industrial purposes.': 287, 'There were factories in Rome in the days of Augustus.': 76, 'New books, for instance, were dictated to rows of copyists in the factories of the booksellers.': 51, 'The attentive\\nstudent of Defoe and of the political pamphlets of Fielding will realize that the idea of herding poor people into\\nestablishments to work collectively for their living was already current in Britain before the close of the\\nseventeenth century.': 878, 'There are intimations of it even as early as Mores Utopia 1516.': 163, 'It was a social and not a\\nmechanical development.': 166, 'Up to past the middle of the eighteenth century the social and economic history of western Europe was in fact\\nretreading the path along which the Roman state had gone in the last three centuries B.C.': 1134, 'But the political\\ndisunions of Europe, the political convulsions against monarchy, the recalcitrance of the common folk and\\nperhaps also the greater accessibility of the western European intelligence to mechanical ideas and inventions,\\nturned the process into quite novel directions.': 816, 'Ideas of human solidarity, thanks to Christianity, were far more\\nwidely diffused in the newer European world, political power was not so concentrated, and the man of energy\\nanxious to get rich turned his mind, therefore, very willingly from the ideas of the slave and of gang labour to the\\nidea of mechanical power and the machine.': 1645, 'The mechanical revolution, the process of mechanical invention and discovery, was a new thing in human\\nexperience and it went on regardless of the social, political, economic and industrial consequences it might\\nproduce.': 969, 'The industrial revolution, on the other hand, like most other human affairs, was and is more and more\\nprofoundly changed and deflected by the constant variation in human conditions caused by the mechanical\\nrevolution.': 703, 'And the essential difference between the amassing of riches, the extinction of small farmers and small\\nbusiness men, and the phase of big finance in the latter centuries of the Roman Republic on the one hand, and the\\nvery similar concentration of capital in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries on the other, lies in the profound\\ndifference in the character of labour that the mechanical revolution was bringing about.': 1128, 'The power of the old\\nworld was human power everything depended ultimately upon the driving power of human muscle, the muscle of\\nignorant and subjugated men.': 1767, 'A little animal muscle, supplied by draft oxen, horse traction and the like,\\ncontributed.': 280, 'Where a weight had to be lifted, men lifted it where a rock had to be quarried, men chipped it out\\nwhere a field had to be ploughed, men and oxen ploughed it the Roman equivalent of the steamship was the\\ngalley with its bank of sweating rowers.': 664, 'A vast proportion of mankind in the early civilizations were employed in\\npurely mechanical drudgery.': 255, 'At its onset, powerdriven machinery did not seem to promise any release from such\\nunintelligent toil.': 73, 'Great gangs of men were employed in excavating canals, in making railway cuttings and\\nembankments, and the like.': 382, 'The number of miners increased enormously.': 80, 'But the extension of facilities and the\\noutput of commodities increased much more.': 186, 'And as the nineteenth century went on, the plain logic of the new\\nsituation asserted itself more clearly.': 626, 'Human beings were no longer wanted as a source of mere

'The\\nhuman being was needed now only where choice and intelligence had to be exercised.': 181, 'Human beings were\\nwanted only as human beings.': 189, 'The drudge, on whom all the previous civilizations had rested, the creature of mere\\nobedience, the man whose brains were superfluous, had become unnecessary to the welfare of mankind.': 369, 'This was as true of such ancient industries as agriculture and mining as it was of the newest metallurgical\\nprocesses.': 125, 'For ploughing, sowing and harvesting, swift machines came forward to do the work of scores of men.': 449, 'The Roman civilization was built upon cheap and degraded human beings modern civilization is being rebuilt\\nupon cheap mechanical power.': 1069, 'For a hundred years power has been getting cheaper and labour dearer.': 354, 'If for a\\ngeneration or so machinery has had to wait its turn in the mine, it is simply because for a time men were cheaper\\nthan machinery.': 466, 'Now here was a changeover of quite primary importance in human affairs.': 255, 'The chief solicitude of the rich and of\\nthe ruler in the old civilization had been to keep up a supply of drudges.': 239, 'As the nineteenth century went on, it\\nbecame more and more plain to the intelligent directive people that the common man had now to be something\\nbetter than a drudge.': 980, 'He had to be educatedif only to secure industrial efficiency.': 27, 'He had to understand what\\nhe was about.': 10, 'From the days of the first Christian propaganda, popular education had been smouldering in\\nEurope, just as it had smouldered in Asia wherever Islam has set its foot, because of the necessity of making the\\nbeliever understand a little of the belief by which he is saved, and of enabling him to read a little in the sacred\\nbooks by which his belief is conveyed.': 792, 'Christian controversies, with their competition for adherents, ploughed the\\nground for the harvest of popular education.': 74, 'In England, for instance, by the thirties and forties of the nineteenth\\ncentury, the disputes of the sects and the necessity of catching adherents young had produced a series of\\ncompeting educational organizations for children, the church National schools, the dissenting British schools,\\nand even Roman Catholic elementary schools.': 582, 'The second half of the nineteenth century was a period of rapid\\nadvance in popular education throughout all the Westernized world.': 979, 'There was no parallel advance in the\\neducation of the upper classessome advance, no doubt, but nothing to correspondand so the great gulf that had\\ndivided that world hitherto into the readers and the nonreading mass became little more than a slightly\\nperceptible difference in educational level.': 1370, 'At the back of this process was the mechanical revolution, apparently\\nregardless of social conditions, but really insisting inexorably upon the complete abolition of a totally illiterate\\nclass throughout the world.': 1165, 'The economic revolution of the Roman Republic had never been clearly apprehended by the common people of\\nRome.': 456, 'The ordinary Roman citizen never saw the changes through which he lived, clearly and comprehensively\\nas we see them.': 205, 'But the industrial revolution, as it went on towards the end of the nineteenth century, was more\\nand more distinctly seen as one whole process by the common people it was affecting, because presently they\\ncould read and discuss and communicate, and because they went about and saw things as no commonalty had ever\\ndone before.': 1566, 'The Development of Modern Political and Social Ideas\\nTHE INSTITUTIONS and customs and political ideas of the ancient civilizations grew up slowly, age by age, no\\nman designing and no man foreseeing.': 940, 'It was only in that great century of human adolescence, the sixth century\\nB.C., that men began to think clearly about their relations to one another, and first to question and first propose to\\nalter and rearrange the established beliefs and laws and methods of human government.': 2460, 'We have told of the glorious intellectual dawn of Greece and Alexandria, and how presently the collapse of the\\nslaveholding civilizations and the clouds of religious intolerance and absolutist government darkened the\\npromise of that beginning.': 337, 'The light of fearless thinking did not break through the European obscurity again\\neffectually until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.': 166, 'We have tried to show something of the share of the great\\nwinds of Arab curiosity and Mongol conquest in this gradual clearing of the mental skies of Europe.': 585, 'And at first itA Short History of the World.': 263, 'The Development of Modern Political and Social Ideas 116was chiefly material knowledge that increased.': 116, 'The first fruits of the recovered manhood of the race were material\\nachievements and material power.': 502, 'The science of human relationship, of individual and social psychology, of\\neducation and of economics, are not only more subtle and intricate in themselves but also bound up inextricably\\nwith much emotional matter.': 615, 'The advances made in them have been slower and made against greater opposition.': 412, 'Men will listen dispassionately to the most diverse suggestions about stars or molecules, but ideas about our ways\\nof life touch and reflect upon everyone about us.': 679, 'And just as in Greece the bold speculations of Plato came before Aristotles hard search for fact, so in Europe the\\nfirst political enquiries of the new phase were put in the form of Utopian stories, directly imitated from Platos\\nRepublic and his Laws.': 969, 'Sir Thomas Mores Utopia is a curious imitation of Plato that bore fruit in a new English\\npoor law.': 318, 'The Neapolitan Campanellas City of the Sun was more fantastic and less fruitful.': 57, 'By the end of the seventeenth century we find a considerable and growing literature of political and social science\\nwas being produced.': 690, 'Among the pioneers in this discussion was John Locke, the son of an English republican, an\\nOxford scholar who first directed his attention to chemistry and medicine.': 355, 'His treatises on government, toleration\\nand education show a mind fully awake to the possibilities of social reconstruction.': 270, 'Parallel with and a little later\\nthan John Locke in England, Montesquieu 16891755 in France subjected social, political and religious\\ninstitutions to a searching and fundamental analysis.': 407, 'He stripped the magical prestige from the absolutist\\nmonarchy in France.': 47, 'He shares with Locke the credit for clearing away many of the false ideas that had hitherto\\nprevented deliberate and conscious attempts to reconstruct human society.': 436, 'The generation that followed him in the middle and later decades of the eighteenth century was boldly speculative\\nupon the moral and intellectual clearings he had made.': 909, 'A group of brilliant writers, the Encyclopaedists, mostly\\nrebel spirits from the excellent schools of the Jesuits, set themselves to scheme out a new world 1766.': 874, 'Side by\\nside with the Encyclopaedists were the Economists or Physiocrats, who were making bold and crude enquiries\\ninto the production and distribution of food and goods.': 105, 'Morelly, the author of the Code de la Nature, denounced\\nthe institution of private property and proposed a communistic organization of society.': 114, 'He was the precursor of\\nthat large and various school of collectivist thinkers in the nineteenth century who are lumped together as\\nSocialists.': 374, 'What is Socialism There are a hundred definitions of Socialism and a thousand sects of Socialists.': 96, 'Essentially\\nSocialism is no more and no less than a criticism of the idea of property in the light of the public good.': 206, 'We may\\nreview the history of that idea through the ages very briefly.': 462, 'That and the idea of internationalism are the two\\ncardinal ideas upon which most of our political life is turning.': 867, 'The idea of property arises out of the combative instincts of the species.': 113, 'Long before men were men, the ancestral\\nape was a proprietor.': 407, 'Primitive property is what a beast will fight for.': 58, 'The dog and his bone, the tigress and her\\nlair, the roaring stag and his herd, these are proprietorship blazing.': 21, 'No more nonsensical expression is conceivable\\nin sociology than the term primitive communism.': 77, 'The Old Man of the family tribe of early palaelithic times\\ninsisted upon his proprietorship in his wives and daughters, in his tools, in his visible universe.': 437, 'If any other man\\nwandered into his visible universe he fought him, and if he could he slew him.': 312, 'The tribe grew in the course of\\nages, as Atkinson showed convincingly in his Primal Law, by the gradual toleration by the Old Man of the\\nexistence of the younger men, and of their proprietorship in the wives they captured from outside the tribe, and in\\nthe tools and ornaments they made and the game they slew.': 599, 'Human society grew by a compromise between this\\nones property and that.': 110, 'It was a compromise with instinct which was forced upon men by the necessity of driving\\nsome other tribe out of its visible universe.': 542, 'If the hills and forests and streams were not your land or my land, it\\nwas because they had to be our land.': 258, 'Each of us would have preferred to have it my land, but that would not work.': 537, 'In that case the other fellows would have destroyed us.': 273, 'Society, therefore, is from its beginning a mitigation of\\nownership.': 54, 'Ownership in the beast and in the primitive savage was far more intense a thing than it is in the\\ncivilized world today.': 795, 'It is rooted more strongly in our instincts than in our reason.A Short History of the World.': 10, 'The Development of Modern Political and Social Ideas 117In the natural savage and in the untutored man today there is no limitation to the sphere of ownership.': 260, 'Whatever\\nyou can fight for, you can own womenfolk, spared captive, captured beast, forest glade, stonepit or what not.': 51, 'As the community grew, a sort of law came to restrain internecine fighting, men developed roughandready\\nmethods of settling proprietorship.': 591, 'Men could own what they were the first to make or capture or claim.': 422, 'It seemed\\nnatural that a debtor who could not pay should become the property of his creditor.': 231, 'Equally natural was it that\\nafter claiming a patch of land a man should exact payments from anyone who wanted to use it.': 331, 'It was only slowly,\\nas the possibilities of organized life dawned on men, that this unlimited property in anything whatever began to be\\nrecognized as a nuisance.': 626, 'Men found themselves born into a universe all owned and claimed, nay they found\\nthemselves born owned and claimed.': 244, 'The social struggles of the earlier civilization are difficult to trace now, but\\nthe history we have told of the Roman Republic shows a community waking up to the idea that debts may become\\na public inconvenience and should then be repudiated, and that the unlimited ownership of land is also an\\ninconvenience.': 948, 'We find that later Babylonia severely limited the rights of property in slaves.': 193, 'Finally, we find in\\nthe teaching of that great revolutionist, Jesus of Nazareth, such an attack upon property as had never been before.': 949, 'Easier it was, he said, for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the owner of great possessions to\\nenter the kingdom of heaven.': 614, 'A steady, continuous criticism of the permissible scope of property seems to have\\nbeen going on in the world for the last twentyfive or thirty centuries.': 797, 'Nineteen hundred years after Jesus of\\nNazareth we find all the world that has come under the Christian teaching persuaded that there could be no\\nproperty in human beings.': 1115, 'And also the idea that a man may do what he likes with his own was very much\\nshaken in relation to other sorts of property.': 605, 'But this world of the closing eighteenth century was still only in the interrogative stage in this matter.': 930, 'It had got\\nnothing clear enough, much less settled enough, to act upon.': 594, 'One of its primary impulses was to protect property\\nagainst the greed and waste of kings and the exploitation of noble adventurers.': 132, 'It was largely to protect private\\nproperty from taxation that the French Revolution began.': 176,

seeking the same ends of liberty and happiness should propose on the one hand\\nto make property as absolute as possible, and on the other to put an end to it altogether.': 828, 'And the\\nclue to this paradox is to be found in the fact that ownership is not one thing but a multitude of different things.': 558, 'It was only as the nineteenth century developed that men began to realize that property was not one simple thing,\\nbut a great complex of ownerships of different values and consequences, that many things such as ones body, the\\nimplements of an artist, clothing, toothbrushes are very profoundly and incurably ones personal property, and\\nthat there is a very great range of things, railways, machinery of various sorts, homes, cultivated gardens, pleasure\\nboats, for

the name of Marx.': 358, 'Marx based his theories on a belief that mens minds are limited by\\ntheir economic necessities, and that there is a necessary conflict of interests in our present civilization between the\\nprosperous and employing classes of people and the employed mass.': 519, 'With the advance in education necessitated\\nby the mechanical revolution, this great employed

'For example, it is steadily truer that the whole planet is now one economic community, that\\nthe proper exploitation of its natural resources demands one comprehensive direction, and that the greater power\\nand range that discovery has given human effort makes the present fragmentary and contentious administration of\\nsuch affairs more and more wasteful and dangerous.': 1142, 'Financial and monetary expedients also become worldwide\\ninterests to be dealt with successfully only on worldwide lines.': 207, 'Infectious diseases and the increase and\\nmigrations of population are also now plainly seen to be worldwide concerns.': 219, 'The greater power and range of\\nhuman activities has also made war disproportionately destructive and disorganizing, and, even as a clumsy way\\nof

than any government that\\nhas hitherto existed.': 243, 'But it does not follow that the solution of these problems lies in some supergovernment of all the world arising\\nby conquest or by the

'Our first\\nnatural reaction is towards some such conclusion, but the discussion and experiences of half a century of\\nsuggestions and attempts has on the whole discouraged belief in that first obvious idea.': 1004, 'Along that line to world\\nunity the resistances are too great.': 957, 'The drift of thought seems now to be in the direction of a number of special\\ncommittees or

equalization of labour\\nconditions, with world peace, with currency, population and health, and so forth.': 1147, 'The world may discover that all its common interests are being managed as one concern, while it still fails to\\nrealize that a world government exists.': 1616, 'But before even so much human unity is attained, before such international\\narrangements can be put above patriotic suspicions and jealousies, it is necessary that the common mind of the\\nrace should be possessed of that idea of human unity, and that the idea of mankind as one family should be a\\nmatter of universal instruction and understanding.': 1248, 'For a score of centuries or more the spirit of the great universal religions has been struggling to maintain and\\nextend that idea of a universal

would make every man the servant of all mankind.': 1445, 'The idea of human brotherhood struggles now to\\npossess the human soul, just as the idea of Christendom struggled to possess the soul of

population developing an energy, enterprise and public spirit far beyond that of\\nany other contemporary population.': 859, 'Then came that acceleration of locomotion to which we have already called attention.': 300, 'It is a curious thing that\\nAmerica, which owes most to this acceleration in locomotion, has felt it least.': 93, 'The United States have taken the\\nrailway, the river steamboat, the telegraph and so forth as though they were a natural part of their growth.': 251, 'These things happened to come along just in time to save American unity.': 384, 'The United States of

would see that stippling creeping slowly along the coastal districts and\\nnavigable waters, spreading still more gradually into Indiana, Kentucky and so forth.': 816, 'Then somewhere about 1810\\nwould come a change.': 266, 'Things would get more lively along the river courses.': 244, 'The dots would be multiplying and\\nspreading.': 204, 'That would be the steamboat.': 185, 'The pioneer dots would be spreading soon over Kansas and Nebraska\\nfrom a number of jumpingoff places along the great rivers.': 758, 'Then from about 1830 onward would come the black lines of the

and security the American people passed through one phase of dire\\nconflict.': 660, 'The river steamboats, the railways, the telegraph, and their associate facilities, did not come soon enough\\nto avert a deepening conflict of interests and ideas between the southern and northern states of the Union.': 402, 'The\\nformer were slaveholding states the latter, states in which all men were free.': 469, 'The railways and steamboats at\\nfirst did but bring into sharper conflict an already established difference between the two sections of the United\\nStates.': 546, 'The increasing unification due to the new means of transport made the question whether the southern spirit\\nor the northern should prevail an ever more urgent one.': 910, 'There was little possibility of compromise.': 116, 'The northern\\nspirit was free and individualistic the southern made for great estates and a conscious gentility ruling over a\\ndusky subject multitude.': 824, 'Every new territory that was organized into a state as the tide of population swept westward, every new\\nincorporation into the fast growing American system, became a field of conflict between the two ideas, whether it\\nshould become a state of free citizens, or whether the estate and slavery system should prevail.': 1457, 'From 1833 an\\nAmerican antislavery society was not merely resisting the extension of the institution but agitating the whole\\ncountry for its complete abolition.': 196, 'The issue flamed up into open conflict over the admission of Texas to the\\nUnion.': 53, 'Texas had originally been a part of the republic of Mexico, but it was largely colonized by Americans\\nfrom the slaveholding states, and it seceded from Mexico, established its independence in 1835, and was\\nannexed to the United States in 1844.': 297, 'Under the Mexican law slavery had been forbidden in Texas, but now the\\nSouth claimed Texas for slavery and got it.': 89, 'Meanwhile the development of ocean navigation was bringing a growing swarm of immigrants from Europe to\\nswell the spreading population of the northern states, and the raising of Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Oregon,\\nall northern farm lands, to state level, gave the antislavery North the possibility of predominance both in the\\nSenate and the House of Representatives.': 551, 'The cottongrowing South, irritated by the growing threat of the\\nAbolitionist movement, and fearing this predominance in Congress, began to talk of secession from the Union.': 159, 'Southerners began to dream of annexations to the south of them in Mexico and

early years had been spent as a drifting particle in the general westward flow of the population.': 370, 'He was born in Kentucky 1809, was taken to Indiana as a boy and later on to Illinois.': 89, 'Life was rough in the\\nbackwoods of Indiana in those days the house was a mere log cabin in the wilderness, and his schooling was poor\\nand casual.': 137, 'But his mother taught him to read early,

a\\nstorekeeper with a drunken partner, and contracted debts that he did not fully pay off for fifteen years.': 501, 'In 1834,\\nwhen he was still only five and twenty, he was elected member of the House of Representatives for the State of\\nIllinois.': 209, 'In Illinois particularly the question of slavery flamed because the great leader of the party for the\\nextension of slavery in the national Congress was Senator Douglas of Illinois.': 586, 'Douglas was a man of great ability\\nand prestige, and for some years Lincoln fought against him by speech and pamphlet, rising steadily to the\\nposition of his most formidable and finally victorious antagonist.': 914, 'Their culminating struggle was the presidential\\ncampaign of 1860, and on the fourth of March, 1861, Lincoln was

dismissed, new generals appointed until at last,\\nunder Sherman and Grant, came victory over the ragged and depleted South.': 550, 'In October, 1864, a Federal army\\nunder Sherman broke through the Confederate left and marched down from Tennessee through Georgia to the\\ncoast, right across the Confederate country, and then turned up through the Carolinas, coming in upon the rear of\\nthe Confederate armies.': 637, 'Meanwhile Grant held Lee before Richmond until Sherman closed on him.': 43, 'On April 9th,\\n1865, Lee and his army surrendered at Appomattox Court House, and within a month all the remaining\\nsecessionist armies had laid down their arms and the Confederacy was at an end.': 214, 'This four years struggle had meant an enormous physical and moral strain for the people of the United States.': 529, 'The principle of state autonomy was very dear to many minds, and the North seemed in effect to be forcing\\nabolition upon the South.': 561, 'In the border states brothers and cousins, even fathers and sons, would take opposite\\nsides and find themselves in antagonistic armies.': 501, 'The North felt its cause a righteous one, but for great numbers of\\npeople it was not a fullbodied and unchallenged righteousness.': 966, 'But for Lincoln there was no doubt.': 23, 'He was a\\nclearminded man in the midst of much confusion.': 314, 'He stood for union he stood for the wide peace of America.': 115, 'He was opposed to slavery, but slavery he held to be a secondary issue his primary purpose was that the United\\nStates should not be torn into two contrasted and jarring fragments.': 227, 'When in the opening stages of the war Congress and the Federal generals embarked upon a precipitate\\nemancipation, Lincoln opposed and mitigated their enthusiasm.': 488, 'He was for emancipation by stages and with\\ncompensation.': 8, 'It was only in January, 1865, that the situation had ripened to a point when Congress could propose\\nto abolish slavery for ever by a constitutional amendment, and the war was already over before this amendment\\nwas ratified by the states.': 494, 'As the war dragged on through 1862 and 1863, the first passions

indeed curbed rather than\\nexpelled, but the greed for rubber, which was a wild product collected under compulsion by the natives in the\\nBelgian Congo, a greed exacerbated by the clash of

three.': 211, 'Hitherto in the\\nhistory of mankind war had gone on only where the armies marched and met.': 573, 'Now it went on everywhere.': 115, 'First\\nthe Zeppelin and then the bombing aeroplane carried war over and past the front to an everincreasing area of\\ncivilian activities beyond.': 273, 'The old distinction maintained in civilized warfare between the civilian and combatant\\npopulation disappeared.': 194, 'Everyone who grew food, or who sewed a garment, everyone who felled a tree or\\nrepaired a house, every railway station and every warehouse was held to be fair game for destruction.': 302, 'The air\\noffensive increased in range and terror with every month in the war.': 269, 'At last great areas of Europe were in a state\\nof siege and subject to nightly raids.': 658, 'Such exposed cities as London and Paris passed sleepless night after\\nsleepless night while the bombs burst, the antiaircraft guns maintained an intolerable racket, and the fire engines\\nand ambulances rattled headlong through the darkened and deserted streets.': 185, 'The effects upon the minds and healthA Short History of the World.': 317, 'The Age of Armament in

people.': 1767, 'Famine also was staved off for some time.': 309, 'By the beginning of 1918 however\\nmost of Europe was in a state of mitigated and regulated famine.': 151, 'The production of food throughout the world had\\nfallen very greatly through the calling off of peasant mankind to the fronts, and the distribution of such food as\\nwas produced was impeded by the havoc wrought by the submarine, by the rupture of customary routes through\\nthe closing of frontiers, and by the disorganization of the transport system of the world.': 1246, 'The various governments\\ntook possession of the dwindling food supplies, and, with more or less success, rationed their populations.': 205, 'By the\\nfourth year the whole world was suffering from shortages of clothing and housing and of most of the normal gear\\nof life as well as of food.': 871, 'Business and economic life were profoundly disorganized.': 256, 'Everyone was worried, and\\nmost people were leading lives of unwonted discomfort.': 274, 'The actual warfare ceased in November, 1918.': 35, 'After a supreme effort in the spring of 1918 that almost carried the\\nGermans to Paris, the Central Powers collapsed.': 117, 'They had come to an end of their spirit and resources.': 169, 'The Revolution and Famine in Russia\\nBUT a good year and more before the collapse of the Central Powers the half oriental monarchy of Russia, which\\nhad professed to be the continuation of the Byzantine Empire, had collapsed.': 159, 'The Tsardom had been showing\\nsigns of profound rottenness for some years before the war the court was under the sway of a fantastic religious\\nimpostor, Rasputin, and the public administration, civil and military, was in a state of extreme inefficiency and\\ncorruption.': 597, 'At the outset of the war there was a great flare of patriotic enthusiasm in Russia.': 608, 'A vast conscript\\narmy was called up, for which there was neither adequate military equipment nor a proper supply of competent\\nofficers, and this great host, ill supplied and badly handled, was hurled against the German and Austrian frontiers.': 707, 'There can be no doubt that the early appearance of Russian armies in East Prussia in September, 1914, diverted\\nthe energies and attention of the Germans from their first victorious drive upon Paris.': 745, 'The sufferings and deaths of\\nscores of thousands of illled Russian peasants saved France from complete overthrow in that momentous\\nopening campaign, and made all western Europe the debtors of that great and tragic people.': 1030, 'But the strain of the\\nwar upon this sprawling, illorganized empire was too heavy for its strength.': 667, 'The Russian common soldiers were\\nsent into battle without guns to support them, without even rifle ammunition they were wasted by their officers\\nand generals in a delirium of militarist enthusiasm.': 386, 'For a time they seemed to be suffering mutely as the beasts\\nsuffer but there is a limit to the endurance even of the most ignorant.': 371, 'A profound disgust for Tsardom was\\ncreeping through these armies of betrayed and wasted men.': 280, 'From the close of 1915 onward Russia was a source\\nof deepening anxiety to her Western Allies.': 64, 'Throughout 1916 she remained largely on defensive, and there were\\nrumours of a separate peace with Germany.': 167, 'On December 29th, 1916, the monk Rasputin was murdered at a dinner party in Petrograd, and a belated attempt\\nwas made to put the Tsardom in order.': 291, 'By March things were moving rapidly food riots in Petrograd developed\\ninto a revolutionary insurrection there was an attempted suppression of the Duma, the representative body, there\\nwere attempted arrests of liberal leaders, the formation of a provisional government under Prince Lvoff, and an\\nabdication March 15th by the Tsar.': 293, 'For a time it seemed that a moderate and controlled revolution might be\\npossibleperhaps under a new Tsar.': 595, 'Then it became evident that the destruction of popular confidence in Russia\\nhad gone too far for any such adjustments.': 282, 'The Russian people were sick to death of the old order of things in\\nEurope, of Tsars and wars and of Great Powers it wanted relief, and that speedily, from unendurable miseries.': 515, 'The Allies had no understanding of Russian realities their diplomatists were ignorant of Russian, genteel persons\\nwith their attention directed to the Russian Court rather than to Russia, they blundered steadily with the new\\nsituation.': 382, 'There was little goodwill among these diplomatists for republicanism, and a manifest disposition toA Short History of the World.': 196, 'The Revolution and Famine in Russia 132embarrass the new government as much as possible.': 494, 'At the head of the Russian republican government was an\\neloquent and picturesque leader, Kerensky, who found himself assailed by the forces of a profounder\\nrevolutionary movement, the social revolution, at home and coldshouldered by the Allied governments abroad.': 441, 'His Allies would neither let him give the Russian peasants the land for which they craved nor peace beyond their\\nfrontiers.': 422, 'The French and the British press pestered their exhausted ally for a fresh offensive, but when presently\\nthe Germans made a strong attack by sea and land upon Riga, the British Admiralty quailed before the prospect of\\na Baltic expedition in relief.': 777, 'The new Russian Republic had to fight unsupported.': 278, 'In spite of their naval\\npredominance and the bitter protests of the great English admiral, Lord Fisher 18411920, it is to be noted that\\nthe British and their Allies, except for some submarine attacks, left the Germans the complete mastery of the\\nBaltic throughout the war.': 793, 'The Russian masses, however, were resolute to end the war.': 236, 'At any cost.': 4, 'There had come into existence in\\nPetrograd a body representing the workers and common soldiers, the Soviet, and this body clamoured for an\\ninternational conference of socialists at Stockholm.': 247, 'Food riots were occurring in Berlin at this time, war weariness\\nin Austria and Germany was profound, and there can be little doubt, in the light of subsequent events, that such a\\nconference would have precipitated a reasonable peace on democratic lines in 1917 and a German revolution.': 831, 'Kerensky implored his Western allies to allow this conference to take place, but, fearful of a worldwide outbreak\\nof socialism and republicanism, they refused, in spite of the favourable response of a small majority of the British\\nLabour Party.': 206, 'Without either moral or physical help from the Allies, the unhappy moderate Russian Republic\\nstill fought on and made a last desperate offensive effort in July.': 573, 'It failed after some preliminary successes, and\\nthere came another great slaughtering of Russians.': 682, 'The limit of Russian endurance was reached.': 47, 'Mutinies broke out in the Russian armies, and particularly upon the\\nnorthern front, and on November 7th, 1917, Kerenskys government was overthrown and power was seized by the\\nSoviets, dominated by the Bolshevik socialists under Lenin, and pledged to make peace regardless of the Western\\npowers.': 799, 'On March 2nd, 1918, a separate peace between Russia and Germany was signed at BrestLitovsk.': 81, 'It speedily became evident that these Bolshevik socialists were men of a very different quality from the rhetorical\\nconstitutionalists and revolutionaries of the Kerensky phase.': 419, 'They were fanatical Marxist communists.': 4, 'They\\nbelieved that their accession to power in Russia was only the opening of a worldwide social revolution, and they\\nset about changing the social and economic order with the thoroughness of perfect faith and absolute\\ninexperience.': 562, 'The western European and the American governments were themselves much too illinformed and\\nincapable to guide or help this extraordinary experiment, and the press set itself to discredit and the ruling classes\\nto wreck these usurpers upon any terms and at any cost to themselves or to Russia.': 676, 'A propaganda of abominable\\nand disgusting inventions went on unchecked in the press of the world the Bolshevik leaders were represented as\\nincredible monsters glutted with blood and plunder and living lives of sensuality before which the realities of the\\nTsarist court during the Rasputin regime paled to a white purity.': 768, 'Expeditions were launched at the exhausted\\ncountry, insurgents and raiders were encouraged, armed and subsidized, and no method of attack was too mean or\\ntoo monstrous for the frightened enemies of the Bolshevik regime.': 152, 'In 1919, the Russian Bolsheviks, ruling a\\ncountry already exhausted and disorganized by five years of intensive warfare, were fighting a British Expedition\\nat Archangel, Japanese invaders in Eastern Siberia, Roumanians with French and Greek contingents in the south,\\nthe Russian Admiral Koltchak in Siberia and General Deniken, supported by the French fleet, in the Crimea.': 497, 'In\\nJuly of that year an Esthonian army, under General Yudenitch, almost got to Petersburg.': 133, 'In 1920 the Poles, incited\\nby the French, made a new attack on Russia and a new reactionary raider, General Wrangel, took over the task of\\nGeneral Deniken in invading and devastating his own country.': 846, 'In March, 1921, the sailors at Cronstadt revolted.': 15, 'The Russian Government under its president, Lenin, survived all these various attacks.': 70, 'It showed an amazing\\ntenacity, and the common people of Russia sustained it unswervingly under conditions of extreme hardship.': 406, 'By\\nthe end of 1921 both Britain and Italy had made a sort of recognition of the communist rule.': 354, 'But if the Bolshevik Government was successful in its struggle against foreign intervention and internal revolt, it\\nwas far less happy in its attempts to set up a new social order based upon communist ideas in Russia.': 1094, 'The Revolution and Famine in Russia 133peasant is a small landhungry proprietor, as far from communism in his thoughts and methods as a whale is from\\nflying the revolution gave him the land of the great landowners but could not make him grow food for anything\\nbut negotiable money, and the revolution, among other things, had practically destroyed the value of money.': 1310, 'Agricultural production, already greatly disordered by the collapse of the railways through warstrain, shrank to a\\nmere cultivation of food by the peasants for their own consumption.': 186, 'The towns starved.': 13, 'Hasty and illplanned\\nattempts to make over industrial production in accordance with communist ideas were equally unsuccessful.': 191, 'By\\n1920 Russia presented the unprecedented spectacle of a modern civilization in complete collapse.': 141, 'Railways were\\nrusting and passing out of use, towns were falling into ruin, everywhere there was an immense mortality.': 93, 'Yet the\\ncountry still fought with its enemies at its gates.': 260, 'In 1921 came a drought and a great famine among the peasant\\ncultivators in the wardevastated southeast provinces.': 707, 'Millions of people starved.': 236, 'But the question of the distresses and the possible recuperation of Russia brings us too close to current\\ncontroversies to be discussed here.': 142, 'The Political and Social Reconstruction of the World\\nTHE SCHEME and scale upon which this History is planned do not permit us to enter into the complicated and\\nacrimonious disputes that centre about the treaties, and particularly of the treaty of Versailles, which concluded\\nthe Great War.': 450, 'We are beginning to realize that that conflict, terrible and enormous as it was, ended nothing,\\nbegan nothing and settled nothing.': 306, 'It killed millions of people it wasted and impoverished the world.': 763, 'It smashed\\nRussia altogether.': 51, 'It was at best an acute and frightful reminder that we were living foolishly and confusedly\\nwithout much plan or foresight in a dangerous and unsympathetic universe.': 280, 'The crudely organized egotisms and\\npassions of national and imperial greed that carried mankind into that tragedy, emerged from it sufficiently\\nunimpaired to make some other similar disaster highly probable so soon as the world has a little recovered from\\nits war exhaustion and fatigue.': 1026, 'Wars and revolutions make nothing their utmost service to mankind is that, in a\\nvery rough and painful way, they destroy superannuated and obstructive things.': 329, 'The great war lifted the threat of\\nGerman imperialism from Europe, and shattered the imperialism of Russia.': 604, 'It cleared away a number of\\nmonarchies.': 83, 'But a multitude of flags still waves in Europe, the frontiers still exasperate, great armies accumulate\\nfresh stores of equipment.': 879, 'The Peace Conference at Versailles was a gathering very ill adapted to do more than carry out the conflicts and\\ndefeats of the war to their logical conclusions.': 187, 'The Germans, Austrians, Turks and Bulgarians were permitted no\\nshare in its deliberations they were only to accept the decisions it dictated to them.': 34, 'From the point of view of\\nhuman welfare the choice of the place of meeting was particularly unfortunate.': 230, 'It was at Versailles in 1871 that,\\nwith every circumstance of triumphant vulgarity, the new German Empire had been proclaimed.': 338, 'The suggestion\\nof a melodramatic reversal of that scene, in the same Hall of Mirrors, was overpowering.': 19, 'Whatever generosities had appeared in the opening phases of the Great War had long been exhausted.': 148, 'The\\npopulations of the victorious countries were acutely aware of their own losses and sufferings, and entirely\\nregardless of the fact that the defeated had paid in the like manner.': 287, 'The war had arisen as a natural and inevitable\\nconsequence of the competitive nationalisms of Europe and the absence of any Federal adjustment of these\\ncompetitive forces war is the necessary logical consummation of independent sovereign nationalities living in too\\nsmall an area with too powerful an armament and if the great war had not come in the form it did it would have\\ncome in some similar formjust as it will certainly return upon a still more disastrous scale in twenty or thirty\\nyears time if no political unification anticipates and prevents it.': 2476, 'States organized for war will make wars as surely\\nas hens will lay eggs, but the feeling of these distressed and warworn countries disregarded this fact, and the\\nwhole of the defeated peoples were treated as morally and materially responsible for all the damage, as they\\nwould no doubt have treated the victor peoples had the issue of war been different.': 1060, 'The French and English\\nthought the Germans were to blame, the Germans thought the Russians, French and English were to blame, and\\nonly an intelligent minority thought that there was anything to blame in the fragmentary political constitution ofA Short History of the World.': 309, 'The treaty of Versailles was intended to be exemplary and vindictive it provided tremendous penalties\\nfor the vanquished it sought to provide compensations for the wounded and suffering victors by imposing\\nenormous debts upon nations already bankrupt, and its attempts to reconstitute international relations by the\\nestablishment of a League of Nations against war were manifestly insincere and inadequate.': 669, 'So far as Europe was concerned it is doubtful if there would have been any attempt whatever to organize\\ninternational relations for a permanent peace.': 425, 'The proposal of the League of Nations was brought into practical\\npolitics by the President of the United States of America, President Wilson.': 72, 'Its chief support was in America.': 52, 'So\\nfar the United States, this new modern state, had developed no distinctive ideas of international relationship\\nbeyond the Monroe Doctrine, which protected the new world from European interference.': 1416, 'Now suddenly it was\\ncalled upon for its mental contribution to the vast problem of the time.': 630, 'It had none.': 9, 'The natural disposition of the\\nAmerican people was towards a permanent world peace.': 858, 'With this however was linked a strong traditional distrust\\nof oldworld politics and a habit of isolation from oldworld entanglements.': 85, 'The Americans had hardly begun to\\nthink out an American solution of world problems when the submarine campaign of the Germans dragged them\\ninto the war on the side of the antiGerman allies.': 719, 'President Wilsons scheme of a League of Nations was an\\nattempt at short notice to create a distinctively American world project.': 643, 'It was a sketchy, inadequate and\\ndangerous scheme.': 20, 'In Europe however it was taken as a matured American point of view.': 72, 'The generality of\\nmankind in 191819 was intensely weary of war and anxious at almost any sacrifice to erect barriers against its\\nrecurrence, but there was not a single government in the old world willing to waive one iota of its sovereign\\nindependence to attain any such end.': 1218, 'The public utterances of President Wilson leading up to the project of a\\nWorld League of Nations seemed for a time to appeal right over the heads of the governments to the peoples of\\nthe world they were taken as expressing the ripe intentions of America, and the response was enormous.': 970, 'Unhappily President Wilson had to deal with governments and not with peoples he was a man capable of\\ntremendous flashes of vision and yet when put to the test egotistical and limited, and the great wave of enthusiasm\\nhe evoked passed and was wasted.': 893, 'Says Dr. Dillon in his book, The Peace Conference Europe, when the President touched its shores, was as clay\\nready for the creative potter.': 45, 'Never before were the nations so eager to follow a Moses who would take them to\\nthe longpromised land where wars are prohibited and blockades unknown.': 352, 'And to their thinking he was just that\\ngreat leader.': 470, 'In France men bowed down before him with awe and affection.': 202, 'Labour leaders in Paris told me that\\nthey shed tears of joy in his presence, and that their comrades would go through fire and water to help him to\\nrealize his noble schemes.': 350, 'To the working classes in Italy his name was a heavenly clarion at the sound of which\\nthe earth would be renewed.': 295, 'The Germans regarded him and his doctrine as their sheetanchor of safety.': 30, 'The\\nfearless Herr Muehlon said If President Wilson were to address the Germans, and pronounce a severe sentence\\nupon them, they would accept it with resignation and without a murmur and set to work at once.': 690, 'In\\nGermanAustria his fame was that of a saviour, and the mere mention of his name brought balm to the suffering\\nand surcease of sorrow to the afflicted.': 108, 'Such were the overpowering expectations that President Wilson raised.': 12, 'How completely he disappointed them\\nand how weak and futile was the League of Nations he made is too long and too distressful a story to tell here.': 379, 'He\\nexaggerated in his person our common human tragedy, he was so very great in his dreams and so incapable in his\\nperformance.': 698, 'America dissented from the acts of its President and would not join the League Europe accepted\\nfrom him.': 195, 'There was a slow realization on the part of the American people that it had been rushed into something\\nfor which it was totally unprepared.': 354, 'There was a corresponding realization on the part of Europe that America had\\nnothing ready to give to the old world in its extremity.': 695, 'Born prematurely and crippled at its birth, that League has\\nbecome indeed, with its elaborate and unpractical constitution and its manifest limitations of power, a serious\\nobstacle in the way of any effective reorganization of international relationships.': 358, 'The problem would be a clearer\\none if the League did not yet exist.': 483, 'Yet that worldwide blaze of enthusiasm that first welcomed the project, that\\nreadiness of men everywhere round and about the earth, of men, that is, as distinguished from governments, for a\\nworld control of war, is a thing to be recorded with emphasis in any history.': 1825, 'Behind the shortsighted\\ngovernments that divide and mismanage human affairs, a real force for world unity and world order exists andA Short History of the World.': 1252, 'The Political and Social Reconstruction of the World 135': 1}\n",
